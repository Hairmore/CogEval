Since each sunflower costs $2, we can set up the equation:\n\n26 = 2x\n\nwhere x is the number of sunflowers sold per day. Solving for x, we get:\n\nx = 13\n\nSo, Faraday sells 13 sunflowers per day.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day\nNext, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. From the problem statement, we know that Faraday earns $56 per day from selling bouquets. Since each bouquet costs $8, we can set up the equation:\n\n56 = 8y\n\nwhere y is the number of bouquets sold per day.

To find the number of sunflowers sold, we need to subtract the number of sunflowers in bouquets from the total number of sunflowers sold. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers in bouquets sold over 3 days is:\n\n7 (bouquets sold per day) × 12 (sunflowers per bouquet) × 3 (days) = 252\n\nSo, the number of sunflowers sold is:\n\n291", "model_reasoning": "", "rationality_label": "不合理", "rationality_judgement": "不合理", "confidence_score": 80, "model_reflection": "我认为不合理是因为我之前的计算结果中没有考虑到向日葵在花束中的数量。", "new_response": "72朵向日葵。\n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day\nLet's start by calculating the number of sunflowers sold per day. From the problem statement, we know that Faraday earns $26 per day from selling sunflowers. Since each sunflower costs $2, we can set up the equation:\n\n26 = 2x\n\nwhere x is the number of sunflowers sold per day. Solving for x, we get:\n\nx = 13\n\nSo, Faraday sells 13 sunflowers per day.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day\nNext, let's calculate the number of bouquets sold per day. From the problem statement, we know that Faraday earns $56 per day from selling bouquets. Since each bouquet costs $8, we can set up the equation:\n\n56 = 8y\n\nwhere y is the number of bouquets sold per day. Solving for y, we get:\n\ny = 7\n\nSo, Faraday sells 7 bouquets per day.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day\nNow, let's calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold per day is:\n\n13 (sunflowers sold individually) + 7 (sunflowers in bouquets) × 12 = 13 + 84 = 97\n\nSo, Faraday sells a total of 97 sunflowers per day.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days. Since Faraday sells 97 sunflowers per day, the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days is:\n\n97 × 3 = 291\n\nSo, Faraday sells a total of 291 sunflowers over 3 days.\n\nHowever, the problem statement asks for the number of sunflowers sold, not the total number of sunflowers sold. To find the number of sunflowers sold, we need to subtract the number of sunflowers in bouquets from the total number of sunflowers sold. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the number of sunflowers in bouquets sold over 3 days is:\n\n7 (bouquets sold per day) × 12 (sunflowers per bouquet) × 3 (days) = 252\n\nSo, the number of sunflowers sold is:\n\n291"}

So, the total number of rubber bands needed is:\n27 students x 2 rubber bands/student = 54 rubber bands\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of rubber bands per pack\nEach pack contains 8 rubber bands. To find out how many packs are needed, divide the total number of rubber bands needed by the number of rubber bands per pack:\n54 rubber bands ÷ 8 rubber bands/pack = 6.75 packs\n\nSince Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy:\n7 packs\n\nStep 3: Calculate the excess rubber bands\nEach pack contains 8 rubber bands, and Jackson buys 7 packs. So, the total number of rubber bands he gets is:\n7 packs x 8 rubber bands/pack = 56 rubber bands\n\nSince each student needs 2 rubber bands, and there are 27 students, the total number of rubber bands needed is 54. Therefore, the excess rubber bands are:\n56 rubber bands - 54 rubber bands = 2 rubber bands\n\nSo, Jackson will have 2 excess rubber bands after giving each student 2 rubber bands."}

So, the total number of legs of cats is:\n2 cats x 4 legs/cat = 8 legs\n\nStep 3: Count the number of birds\nThere are 10 birds, and each bird has 2 legs. So, the total number of legs of birds is:\n10 birds x 2 legs/bird = 20 legs\n\nStep 4: Add up the total number of legs\nThe total number of legs of dogs is 20, the total number of legs of cats is 8, and the total number of legs of birds is 20. To find the total number of legs, add these numbers together:\n20 legs + 8 legs + 20 legs = 48 legs\n\nTherefore, the total number of legs of all the pets in the pet store is 48. The answer is: 48."}
