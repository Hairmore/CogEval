Wait, no, the \"twice\" applies to the entire \"jump right\"? Hmm. Wait, the structure here is \"jump right\" modified by \"twice\". So \"jump right\" is the verb phrase, and \"twice\" means to repeat that sequence twice. But wait, according to rule 4, \"verb twice\" means repeat the verb sequence twice. But \"jump right\" might be considered a compound verb here. Or maybe \"jump\" is the verb and \"right\" is a direction. Wait, the primitive verbs are mapped to uppercase actions. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump\" is a primitive verb, and \"right\" here might be part of the direction. Wait, but in the example given: \"jump around right\" maps to four turns right and jumps each time. So \"around right\" is a direction. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the rules again. Rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" means two turns in DIR then the verb. Rule3: \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"jump right\" could be the verb being jump and direction right. But according to the primitive verbs, \"jump\" is a verb, and \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitives. So \"jump right\" might be parsed as a verb followed by direction, but according to the rules, how?\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump right\" would be interpreted as jumping in the right direction. But according to the mapping, the primitive verbs are just the verbs. So \"jump\" would be I_JUMP, but \"jump right\" might be a different construct. Wait, maybe \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"jump\" in the right direction. However, the problem says that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are verbs themselves. So \"jump\" is a verb, and \"turn right\" is a verb. Therefore, \"jump right\" may not be a primitive verb, unless \"jump right\" is a separate verb. Wait, but according to the first rule: primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump right\" is not a primitive verb. Wait, maybe \"jump right\" is \"jump\" with direction right, but according to the rules, how is that handled?\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump right\" is just \"I_JUMP\" followed by a direction. Or maybe \"jump\" is the verb and \"right\" is a direction modifier, but how does that interact with the other rules? Let's look at the example given in the problem. The input \"jump around right\" becomes \"I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\" repeated four times. So \"around right\" is a modifier on the jump verb. So when you have a verb followed by a direction with \"around\", it's handled by rule 3. Similarly, \"opposite <DIR>\" is a modifier on the verb.\n\nBut in the current input, we have \"jump right twice and walk thrice\". Let's parse this step by step. \n\nThe command is \"jump right twice and walk thrice\". Breaking it into parts: \"jump right twice\" and \"walk thrice\". \n\nFor \"jump right twice\": The phrase \"jump right\" could be parsed as \"jump\" followed by direction \"right\", but how? But according to the rules, \"opposite <DIR>\" and \"around <DIR>\" are modifiers. So \"right\" here may not be part of a modifier like \"around right\" or \"opposite right\". So if \"jump right\" is not using one of the modifiers, then maybe \"jump\" and \"right\" are separate verbs? Wait, that can't be. Wait, \"right\" could be a direction for a turn. Wait, but in the primitive verbs, \"turn right\" is a verb. So \"jump\" is a verb, and \"right\" by itself is not a verb. Therefore, perhaps \"jump right\" is a misinterpretation, and the correct way is that \"jump\" is a verb, and \"right\" is part of a structure. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"jump\" modified by \"right\". But according to the rules, unless there's a specific modifier like \"around\" or \"opposite\", \"right\" alone might not do anything. Hmm. Wait, but in the example, \"jump around right\" uses the \"around <DIR>\" rule. So maybe \"jump right\" would be parsed as a simple verb \"jump\" followed by direction \"right\"? But direction isn't used in the primitives. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" here is equivalent to \"turn right\" then \"jump\", but according to which rule? Or perhaps the \"right\" in this case is a direction for the verb. But the problem's rules don't specify how to handle a direction without a modifier like \"around\" or \"opposite\".\n\nWait, perhaps the \"right\" here is not a direction modifier but part of a compound command. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo. But given the problem, I need to parse \"jump right twice and walk thrice\" according to the given rules.\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump right\" is a mistake. Or perhaps \"jump right\" should be interpreted as \"jump\" and then \"turn right\", but according to the rules? Let me check again.\n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR direction then the verb. So for example, \"opposite left\" would be two turns left, then the verb.\n\nRule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = repeat [turn DIR + verb] four times.\n\nRule 4: \"verb twice\" = repeat verb sequence twice.\n\nSo \"jump right\" could be interpreted as \"jump\" followed by a direction \"right\", but how does that map to the rules? If the right is part of a modifier, but there's no \"around\" or \"opposite\". Therefore, maybe \"right\" here is not a modifier, but part of the verb phrase. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" isn't covered by these modifiers, so \"jump\" is a primitive verb, and \"right\" is ignored. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump right\" is parsed as \"jump\" and then \"turn right\", but that's not stated by any rule. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is that \"jump right\" is a verb followed by a direction. But according to the rules, unless there's a modifier like \"around\", direction alone would not do anything. Therefore, maybe \"jump right\" is not a valid command. But given that the user provided the input, we have to parse it according to the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is a mistake, and the intended meaning is \"turn right then jump\", but under what rule? For example, in the \"opposite\" case, which would be two turns. Or perhaps the \"right\" here is part of a direction for the jump, which isn't covered by the rules, so the system should ignore it. But that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input is ambiguous. But perhaps the way to parse it is that \"jump right\" is \"jump\" and then \"turn right\". But the rules don't state that. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is structured so that \"jump right\" would be equivalent to the verb \"jump\" followed by direction \"right\", but how to map that. Wait, in the example \"jump around right\", the \"around right\" applies to the verb. So the structure is verb + modifier. But if there's a verb followed by a direction without a modifier, perhaps the system doesn't handle that. Then how should we parse \"jump right\"?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump right\" is a mistake and should be treated as \"jump\" and \"turn right\". But according to which rule? The rules don't specify that a direction after a verb implies a turn. Unless there's a missing rule. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the rules are given. So perhaps the user intended \"jump right\" to be \"jump\" followed by \"turn right\", but how does that fit into the existing rules?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"right\" here is a direction for the jump, but according to the rules, direction modifiers are only handled via \"opposite\" or \"around\", so \"right\" here is just invalid, but we have to parse it. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is a misphrasing and the intended meaning is \"turn right\" and then jump, but again, without a rule to handle that, we can't assume.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is a typo, and the correct input should be \"jump around right\" or \"opposite right jump\". But given that's not the case, maybe the problem expects that \"jump right\" is just \"jump\" and then \"turn right\", but how?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach the input again: \"jump right twice and walk thrice\".\n\nBreaking down the command:\n\nThe command is composed of two parts: A and B, connected by \"and\", which according to rule5 means do A then B in order.\n\nSo first parse \"jump right twice\", then parse \"walk thrice\", then combine them.\n\nNow, \"jump right twice\": The \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. According to rule4: \"verb twice", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The original command 'jump right twice and walk thrice' is parsed as follows: 'jump right twice' implies jumping to the right twice, which translates to [I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT] repeated twice. Then 'walk thrice' means walking three times, which translates to I_WALK repeated three times. The conjunction 'and' indicates sequential execution, so the full sequence becomes: I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_WALK I_WALK. This aligns with the rules provided, particularly rules 1, 4, and 5. There is no ambiguity in the phrasing, and the interpretation matches the expected behavior.", "new_response": "None"}

The user input is \"turn around left twice after walk around right\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the structure. According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So here, \"turn around left twice\" is A, and \"walk around right\" is B. Therefore, the order should be B first, then A.\n\nStarting with B: \"walk around right\". Rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"walk around right\" would be four times turning right and walking. That translates to: I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK repeated four times. So expanding that: I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK.\n\nNow A: \"turn around left twice\". Wait, \"turn around left\" is a primitive verb? No, wait. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn around left\" is a compound command. Let's parse \"turn around left\". According to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" would be four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. But here the verb is \"turn left\". Wait, \"turn around left\" would mean doing \"turn left\" four times? Or wait, maybe \"turn around left\" is a different command. Wait, no. Let's check the rules again.\n\nRule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the entire verb phrase that follows \"around\" is the verb here. For example, in the example \"jump around right\", it was four turns right and jumps. So in \"turn around left\", the verb is \"turn left\". Wait, but \"turn left\" is a primitive verb. Wait, the structure is \"turn around left\" would be \"around left\" applied to the verb \"turn\". Wait, but the original example uses \"jump around right\", where the verb is \"jump\". So \"turn around left\" would be the same structure: around left, so four times [turn left + turn]. Wait, but \"turn\" here would be the verb. Wait, but \"turn around left\" might be parsed as \"turn (around left)\", but according to the rules, \"around\" applies to a direction and a verb. Hmm, perhaps the original command is \"turn around left\", which would be parsed as \"around left\" applied to the verb \"turn\". Wait, but \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn\" alone isn't a primitive. So perhaps \"turn around left\" is a compound command. Let me think.\n\nWait, \"turn around left\" would be \"around left\" applied to the verb \"turn left\"? No. Let me parse \"turn around left\". Let's see: \"turn around\" is a common phrase meaning to turn 180 degrees, but the rules don't mention that. According to the rules, \"around <DIR>\" is a modifier on a verb. So \"turn around left\" would be a verb followed by \"around left\". Wait, but \"turn\" is the verb, and \"around left\" is the modifier. Wait, but the original example was \"jump around right\", which is verb \"jump\" with \"around right\". So if the command is \"turn around left\", then the verb is \"turn\", but \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, but the primitives are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". So maybe \"turn around left\" is parsed as follows: the verb is \"turn left\", and \"around\" is a modifier? No, because \"around left\" would be the direction. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, the input here is \"turn around left twice after walk around right\". Let's re-express the components. Let's split into B and A. B is \"walk around right\", which we already handled. A is \"turn around left twice\". Let's parse \"turn around left twice\".\n\nBreaking down \"turn around left twice\": The main verb here is \"turn\", but considering the primitives, perhaps \"turn around left\" is a single verb phrase. Alternatively, \"around left\" modifies the verb \"turn left\". Wait, but according to the rules, \"around <DIR>\" applies to a verb. So \"turn around left\" would be the verb \"turn\" with \"around left\", but \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, the primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So the verb here must be either of those. So perhaps \"turn around left\" is \"turn left\" as the verb, modified by \"around left\"? Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe \"turn around left\" is \"turn\" (which is not a primitive) followed by \"around left\", but that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe \"around left\" applies to the verb \"turn left\". Wait, but how? Let's think.\n\nWait, perhaps \"turn around left\" is the same as \"turn left around left\"? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe \"turn around left\" is equivalent to \"turn left twice\" because \"opposite left\" is two turns left, but \"around left\" would be four repetitions. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem is \"turn around left twice\". Let's parse \"turn around left\" first. The verb here must be one of the primitives. So \"turn left\" is a primitive verb. Then \"around left\" modifies that verb. So \"walk around right\" means \"around right\" applied to the verb \"walk\", which would be four times turn right and walk. Similarly, \"turn around left\" would be \"around left\" applied to the verb \"turn left\"? Wait, that might be a way to parse. Wait, \"turn left\" is the verb. Then \"around left\" would mean four repetitions of [turn left + verb], which is turn left and turn left again. Wait, but that would be turn left and turn left again each time. Wait, no: \"around left\" would be [turn left + verb], so for each step in around left, you turn left and then do the verb. But the verb here is \"turn left\", so each of the four steps would be: turn left, then turn left again. So four times that.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Let's take the original example: jump around right. The output was four turns right and jumps. So the pattern is turn right, jump, repeated four times. So in general, for a verb V and around DIR, it's [turn DIR, V] repeated four times.\n\nSo, if the verb is \"turn left\", then \"turn around left\" would be [turn left, turn left] four times? But that would be each around step: turn left, then do the verb (turn left). But doing that four times would add up to four left turns plus four more left turns, totaling eight left turns. Hmm, but that's a possible interpretation.\n\nBut wait, what's the verb in \"turn around left\". The verb here must be a primitive verb. So the primitive verb here is \"turn left\", and \"around left\" is modifying it. So \"turn around left\" would be \"around left\" applied to the verb \"turn left\", which would be four repetitions of [turn left + I_TURN_LEFT].\n\nWait, but that would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT (turn left), then I_TURN_LEFT (the verb). So each around step is turn left, then do the verb (turn left again). So each repetition adds two left turns. Four times would give eight left turns. But that seems like a lot, but according to the rules, that's how it would parse.\n\nSo \"turn around left\" would translate to:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT repeated four times, each preceded by a turn left. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the structure is [turn DIR + verb], so for each of four times, you turn DIR (left), then do the verb (turn left). So each iteration would be I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT.\n\nSo four times:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT repeated four times. Which is eight I_TURN_LEFTs.\n\nBut then \"turn around left twice\" would be applying rule 4: twice. So first parse \"turn around left\", then repeat that twice.\n\nWait, no: rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"turn around left\" would be verb \"turn left\" with \"around left\", so the expansion would be:\n\n[I_TURN_LEFT (turn DIR left), I_TURN_LEFT (verb)] four times, so each pair is two left turns, four times total 8 left turns.\n\nThen \"turn around left twice\" would be rule 4: twice. Wait, rule 4 says \"around DIR\" is four repetitions. But \"twice\" is rule 4. Wait, rule 4 says that \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"turn around left\" is a verb sequence (which itself is four repetitions of [turn DIR left + verb]), then \"twice\" would repeat that entire sequence twice.\n\nWait, wait. Let's parse \"turn around left twice\". The \"twice\" applies to the verb phrase \"turn around left\". So \"turn around left\" is the verb modified by \"twice\". So according to rule 4, \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So first expand \"turn around left\" into its action sequence, then repeat that entire sequence twice.\n\nThe expansion of \"turn around left\" (verb) would be:\n\nUsing rule 3", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 40, "model_reflection": "The initial response incorrectly expanded the semantics of 'turn around left twice after walk around right'.

The input is \"turn around right thrice and walk right\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part. Starting with \"turn around right thrice\". The \"around right\" part means turning right and then performing the verb (turn) four times. Wait, the rule says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb is \"turn\", so each repetition would be turning right and then turning again. Wait, but \"turn around right\" would be \"around right\" applied to the verb \"turn\". Wait, no: the original command is \"turn around right thrice\", which might be parsed as \"turn (around right) thrice\". Hmm.\n\nWait, the command is \"turn around right thrice and walk right\". Let's split into parts: The first part is \"turn around right thrice\", then \"walk right\", and they are connected by \"and\", which means do A then B. So first process \"turn around right thrice\" and then \"walk right\".\n\nStarting with \"turn around right thrice\". Let's see. The structure here is \"turn around right\" modified by \"thrice\". Wait, but \"around right\" is a direction modifier. According to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. The verb here is \"turn\". Wait, but \"turn around right\" would be the verb \"turn\" with the \"around right\" modifier. So \"around right\" applied to \"turn\" would generate 4 repetitions of [turn right then turn]. But wait, the verb here is \"turn\", so each repetition would be turning right and then doing the verb (turn), which is another turn. So each cycle would be I_TURN_RIGHT followed by I_TURN. Then repeat this four times. But then \"turn around right thrice\" adds \"thrice\", which means repeat the entire sequence three times.\n\nWait, wait. Let me clarify. The original structure is \"turn around right thrice\". Let's parse this. \"around right\" applies to the verb \"turn\", so first, \"turn around right\" would be the base action, then \"thrice\" modifies that entire action. So first, \"turn around right\" is processed as per rule 3. The verb is \"turn\", so \"around right\" means 4 repetitions of [turn right + turn]. So each repetition is turning right, then turning. Wait, but what's the exact sequence here. The verb is \"turn\", so each time you turn right, then do the verb (turn). But the verb is just a single action. So for each of the 4 repetitions, you do turn right and then turn. Wait, but each repetition is [turn DIR + verb], so each repetition is two actions. So four times that would be 4 * 2 = 8 actions. Then \"thrice\" means repeat that entire sequence three times. Wait, no: \"verb thrice\" means repeat the verb sequence three times. Wait, \"turn around right thrice\" is \"around right\" followed by \"thrice\". So first, \"turn around right\" is the action, then \"thrice\" means repeat that action three times. Wait, but according to rule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice; similarly for \"thrice\". So if the entire phrase is \"turn around right thrice\", then \"turn around right\" is the verb sequence, and \"thrice\" tells us to repeat it three times.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse the command as \"turn around right\" as the verb phrase, then \"thrice\" applies to that. Then \"walk right\" as another verb. And \"and\" means do both in order.\n\nFirst, process \"turn around right\" which is \"around right\" applied to \"turn\". According to rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. The verb here is \"turn\", so each repetition is I_TURN_RIGHT followed by I_TURN. So four times that would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN.\n\nWait, no. Wait, each repetition is [turn DIR + verb], which for \"around right\" and verb \"turn\" would be [turn right, turn], and then four repetitions of that. So each repetition is two actions, four times:\n\nTurn right, turn, turn right, turn, turn right, turn, turn right, turn. Which would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN.\n\nThen \"thrice\" would mean repeating this entire sequence three times. Wait, but according to rule 4, \"thrice\" applies to the verb. Wait, the structure here is \"turn around right thrice\". So \"turn around right\" is the verb phrase, then \"thrice\" says to repeat that entire verb phrase three times.\n\nSo first, \"turn around right\" is the action that takes 4 repetitions of [turn right + turn], which is 8 actions. Then \"thrice\" would mean doing that entire sequence three times. So total of 8 * 3 = 24 actions. But wait, the rule says \"verb twice = repeat the verb sequence twice\". So \"turn around right thrice\" would be the verb sequence \"turn around right\" repeated three times. Wait, but \"around right\" itself is a modifier. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"around right\" is part of the verb. Let's parse \"turn around right\" first. So \"turn around right\" is a verb with an around modifier. Then \"thrice\" applies to that verb. So the verb sequence is \"turn around right\", which is 4 repetitions of [turn right + turn], then doing that entire sequence three times. So each time, you do \"around right\" for the turn verb, which is 4 repetitions, and then multiply by three because of \"thrice\".\n\nBut according to rule 4, \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"turn around right thrice\" would be the verb sequence \"turn around right\" repeated three times. Which would mean that each \"around right\" is done three times. Wait, no, because \"around right\" is already expanding into 4 repetitions. So how do the modifiers stack?\n\nLet me think again. Let's take the example given in the problem statement:\n\nIN: jump around right\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSo \"around right\" applied to jump gives 4 repetitions of [turn right + jump], which would be four jumps around. But the output has four turns and four jumps. Wait, the output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times, but the last step is a turn without jump. Wait, the example output ends with a turn. Wait in the example:\n\nInput: jump around right\n\nThe output has four repetitions of [turn right, jump], but the output ends with a turn right. Wait, let me check:\n\nThe output is: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times, but between each jump and next turn? No:\n\nLooking at the example:\n\nThe output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT ?\n\nWait, no, the example output is written as:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, wait, in the example, the output has 4 turns right and 4 jumps? Let's count:\n\nThe output sequence:\n\nTurn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right.\n\nWait, that's three jumps and four turns. Hmm. Wait, the first action is I_TURN_RIGHT, then I_JUMP. Then repeat. So in total, four I_TURN_RIGHT actions, each followed by a jump except the last one. So how many times do you turn right? Four times, each time before jumping except the last turn. So the example output is 4 turns and 3 jumps? Or maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, the example input is \"jump around right\", which according to rule 3 should be four repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So four times: turn right, jump. So four times each. But the example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT ?\n\nWait, no, looking at the example output:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, that's three jumps and four turns right. So perhaps the example output is incorrect? Or perhaps there's a mistake in the example. Wait, the user's example shows that \"jump around right\" becomes four turns and four jumps? Hmm.\n\nWait, the example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSo the number of I_TURN_RIGHT is four times. The jumps are three times. That seems odd. But according to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition includes a turn and a verb. So four times each. So four turns and four jumps. But the example output shows three jumps and four turns. That suggests that the fourth turn is done but not followed by a jump. Wait, perhaps the rule is that \"around\" is four turns and four verbs (like jump), but the example is wrong? Or perhaps the example is correct. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal example:\n\nInput: jump around", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 45, "model_reflection": "The original interpretation of 'turn around right thrice' incorrectly assumed that 'turn' is the verb to be repeated, but the phrase 'turn around right' already implies a full rotation (4 repetitions of [turn right + walk]).

The input is \"turn opposite left twice after turn opposite right\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part. Let's start with \"turn opposite right\". According to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" means two turns in DIR direction. So \"opposite right\" would be two right turns. So \"turn opposite right\" translates to two I_TURN_RIGHT actions.\n\nThen there's \"turn opposite left twice after\" that. The \"after\" means we do the first part after the second part. Wait, rule 6 says \"A after B\" means B then A. So the structure here is: \"A after B\" becomes B followed by A. \n\nThe command is structured as \"A after B\" where A is \"turn opposite left twice\" and B is \"turn opposite right\". So first we do B (turn opposite right), then A (turn opposite left twice). \n\nNow, \"turn opposite left twice\" is a bit tricky. The \"twice\" applies to the entire \"turn opposite left\" action. Wait, no. Wait, the phrase is \"turn opposite left twice\". Let me parse that. The \"opposite left\" is the direction, so \"turn opposite left\" would be two left turns. Then \"twice\" would mean doing that sequence twice. So each \"turn opposite left\" is two I_TURN_LEFT actions, and doing that twice would be four I_TURN_LEFTs. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFirst, process B: \"turn opposite right\" → two I_TURN_RIGHTs → I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nThen process A: \"turn opposite left twice\". Let's break this down. \"opposite left\" is two left turns. Then \"twice\" means repeating that sequence twice. So each \"turn opposite left\" is two left turns, so twice would be two times that sequence. So that's (I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT) repeated twice → I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the command is \"turn opposite left twice\". The \"twice\" applies to the entire \"turn opposite left\" action. Or does it? Let's re-examine. The phrase is \"turn opposite left twice after turn opposite right\". So \"turn opposite left twice\" as A. The \"twice\" could modify the entire \"turn opposite left\" or just the \"turn\". Hmm, according to the rules, \"verb twice\" means repeat the verb sequence twice. So the verb here would be \"turn opposite left\", but \"opposite left\" is a direction. Wait, perhaps the structure is that \"turn opposite left\" is a verb phrase, and then \"twice\" applies to that. So \"turn opposite left twice\" would be doing that verb phrase twice. But according to rule 2, \"turn opposite left\" is two turns left. Then \"twice\" would mean doing that entire action (two turns left) twice. So each \"turn opposite left\" is two left turns, and doing that twice would be four left turns. \n\nTherefore, the entire sequence would be:\n\nB (turn opposite right) → I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nA (turn opposite left twice) → two times (I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT) → so four I_TURN_LEFTs. \n\nThen the entire command is B followed by A, so:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, \"turn opposite left twice\" would be \"turn opposite left\" done twice. Each \"turn opposite left\" is two left turns. So two times two left turns → four left turns. So the sequence for A is four I_TURN_LEFTs. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nOriginal command: A after B → B then A.\n\nA is \"turn opposite left twice\" → four I_TURN_LEFTs.\n\nB is \"turn opposite right\" → two I_TURN_RIGHTs.\n\nSo the output is B followed by A: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT.\n\nWait, but wait again. Let me check again.\n\nRule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if the verb is \"turn opposite left\", then \"twice\" would repeat that entire verb's sequence. But \"turn opposite left\" is equivalent to two left turns. So \"turn opposite left twice\" would be two times two left turns, so four left turns. Therefore, yes, four I_TURN_LEFTs.\n\nSo the output sequence would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT (from B), then I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT (from A).\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT\n", "rationality_label": "Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The original command is 'turn opposite left twice after turn opposite right'.

Then \"thrice\" means we repeat the previous verb three times. So \"turn right thrice\" would be I_TURN_RIGHT repeated three times.\n\nNext part is \"look around right thrice\". The verb here is \"look\", which should map to I_LOOK. The \"around right\" part follows rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" means 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"around right\" would be [I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK] repeated four times. Then \"thrice\" means we repeat the entire \"look around right\" sequence three times. That would be the [I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK] x4 block repeated three times.\n\nPutting it all together, the first part is three I_TURN_RIGHTs, followed by the second part which is three repetitions of four I_TURN_RIGHT and I_LOOK pairs. Let me check if I got the grouping right. Yes, \"around right thrice\" would be each around right (which is four steps) done three times. So the entire sequence is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT (from turn right thrice)\nThen, three times:\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT (each around right)\nAnd another two around rights (each with four steps), making three in total.\n\nWait, no. Wait, \"look around right thrice\". The \"around right\" is one unit, which is four repetitions of [turn right + look]. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeat that entire around right three times. But wait, the original example for \"jump around right\" was four turns and jumps. So each \"around\" direction is four repetitions. So \"look around right\" would be [I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK] x4. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeat that entire sequence three times. So each \"around right\" is four steps, and doing that three times would be 3 * 4 * 2 (since each around has a turn and a look). Wait, but the original example for \"jump around right\" gives 4 turns and 4 jumps. So yes, each around direction is 4 times. So \"look around right\" would be [I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK] repeated 4 times, and \"thrice\" would mean doing this entire block three times. Therefore, the second part is [I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK] repeated 4 * 3 = 12 times? No, wait, no. Wait, the \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb], so \"look around right\" is [turn right look] four times. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeat that entire sequence three times. So each \"around right\" is four [turn right look], so three times would be 4 * 3 [turn right look]. Wait, but according to rule 4, \"verb twice\" is repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"look around right thrice\" would be the \"look around right\" done three times. But \"around right\" itself is four repetitions. Therefore, \"around right thrice\" would be each around right (four [turn right look]) done three times. So total of 4 * 3 [turn right look] sequences.\n\nWait, but how to parse \"look around right thrice\". The verb is \"look\", then \"around right\" is a modifier. Then \"thrice\" applies to the entire \"look around right\". Hmm. Wait, according to the rules: rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if the verb phrase is \"look around right\", then \"thrice\" would mean repeat that entire sequence three times.\n\nWait, the original example was \"jump around right\" which becomes four turns and four jumps, so the \"around right\" modifies the verb. So \"look around right\" would be [I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK] four times. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeating that entire sequence three times. So the second part would be [I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK] repeated 4 times, and that block is repeated 3 times. So total of 4*3 times the pair.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFirst part: turn right thrice → I_TURN_RIGHT repeated three times.\n\nSecond part: look around right thrice → [ (I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK) x4 ] repeated thrice.\n\nTherefore, the entire output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT \n\nThen, three times:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK \n\nThen another four:\n\nSame as above again?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me parse the second part. Let's take \"look around right\" first. \"look\" is the verb, so \"look around right\" would be the verb modified by \"around right\". According to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"look around right\" would be [turn right + look] repeated four times. So that's [I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK] repeated four times. Then \"thrice\" would mean doing that entire sequence three times. So each \"look around right thrice\" is [I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK] x4, done three times, so total of 4*3 = 12 pairs. But wait, no. Wait, rule 4 says that \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if the verb is \"look around right\", then \"thrice\" would mean repeat that entire verb sequence three times. But the verb sequence itself is already \"around right\" modified. So the \"around right\" is the verb \"look\" modified by \"around right\", which is [turn right look] x4. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeat that entire [turn right look] x4 three times. So yes, [turn right look] x4 * 3. So the second part is [I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK] repeated 4 times, then again twice more, so 12 total.\n\nSo combining both parts:\n\nFirst three I_TURN_RIGHTs.\n\nThen the around right look thrice: each around right look is four [turn right look], so three times would be 4*3 [turn right look].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT \n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK \n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK \n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK \n\nWait, but that's three blocks of four [turn right look]. Each \"around right\" is four, and then thrice, so three times four. So total of 12 [turn right look] pairs.\n\nSo the entire action sequence is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT x3, then I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK repeated 12 times? No, wait. No, each \"look around right\" is [I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK] x4. Then \"thrice\" would mean doing that entire \"look around right\" three times. So each around right is four [turn right look], so three around rights would be three times four, which is 12 [turn right look] pairs.\n\nSo the final output should have:\n\nFirst, three I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nThen, twelve [I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK] pairs.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Because the \"look around right thrice\" is \"around right\" thrice. Wait, no. Wait, the command is \"look around right thrice\". The \"around right\" is part of the verb modifier. So \"look around right\" is the verb sequence, and then thrice. Then \"look around right\" is [turn right + look] four times. Then thrice would mean repeat that entire \"look around right\" three times. Which would mean three times four [turn right + look] pairs.\n\nBut wait, how? Each around right is four [turn right look], so doing \"around right\" three times would be three times four, which would be 12 [turn right look] pairs. So yes.\n\nTherefore, the entire action sequence is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT \n\nThen, I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK repeated four times, then again four times, then again four times? No, no grouping. Wait, no. The \"look around right\" is expanded as [turn look] four times. Then \"thrice\" would repeat the entire \"look around right\" three times. So each \"look around right\" is four [turn look], so three times four would be 12 [turn look] pairs.\n\nBut in the example given, \"jump around right\" becomes [turn right jump] four times. So the same applies here.\n\nSo combining both parts:\n\nThe first part: turn right thrice → three I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nThe second part: look around right thrice → three times (four [I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK]).\n\nWhich equals:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK repeated four times, done three times. So each block of four is repeated three times.\n\nWait, but according to the rules, how are modifiers combined? Let me check the example again. The example input is \"jump around right\", output is four turns and four jumps. So each around direction is four repetitions of [turn dir + verb]. So \"look around right\" would be [I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK] four times.\n\nThen \"look around right thrice\" would be that sequence repeated three times.

The input is \"walk opposite right after run right thrice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the structure. According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So here, \"walk opposite right\" is A, and \"run right thrice\" is B. So the overall order is B followed by A.\n\nLet's handle B first: \"run right thrice\". Rule 4 says \"thrice\" means repeat three times. So \"run right\" is the base action. \"run\" maps to I_RUN, and \"right\" is turning right. But wait, \"run right\" could be interpreted as running to the right, but according to the primitive verbs, \"run\" is just I_RUN. Hmm, maybe \"run right\" is a direction? Wait, the rules mention \"turn left/right\" map to I_TURN_LEFT/RIGHT. So \"run right\" might mean turning right then running? Or is \"run right\" considered as a single verb with direction? Wait, looking at the rules again. Rule 1 says primitive verbs map to actions. The examples include \"run around right\" which in the example output uses I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN repeated. So in the example, \"around right\" leads to turning right then jumping. So it seems that when a direction follows a verb, it's a turn in that direction followed by the verb. Wait, but the example for \"jump around right\" gives turns and jumps alternated. So perhaps \"around <DIR>\" is a specific case. Let's get back to this.\n\nThe B part is \"run right thrice\". But \"run right\" isn't using the \"around\" or \"opposite\" constructs. So how to parse \"run right\"? The rules don't have a direct mapping here. Wait, looking at the example input \"jump around right\" which translates to four repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So \"around right\" is a modifier on the verb. But in the current problem, we have \"run right\" which might just be a direction. Wait, perhaps \"run right\" is equivalent to \"turn right then run\". Because \"run\" is a primitive verb. But the original rules don't specify that. Wait, the first rule says that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So \"run\" is I_RUN. Directions when combined with verbs may have specific rules, but only \"opposite\" and \"around\" are covered in the rules. So \"run right\" would be the verb \"run\" followed by a direction. Wait, but how is that parsed? Since the rules don't mention direction modifiers unless in the context of \"opposite\" or \"around\". Hmm, maybe \"run right\" is simply a way to say run in the right direction, but according to the given rules, how to translate that into actions. Wait, but in the example, \"jump around right\" uses the turn right and jump. So maybe the structure is that a direction after a verb (not under \"around\" or \"opposite\") would imply turning in that direction then performing the action. Wait, but the user hasn't specified that. Let's check the problem again.\n\nThe problem's rules:\n\nRule 2: opposite <DIR> = two turns in DIR then the verb.\n\nRule3: around <DIR> = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]\n\nRule4: verb twice = repeat verb sequence twice; thrice same.\n\nRule5: A and B = A then B.\n\nRule6: A after B = do B then A.\n\nSo \"run right\" isn't covered by the rules. Wait, but the problem says \"semantic parsing agent for navigation commands\" and the user input is \"run right thrice\". Wait, perhaps \"run right\" is a command where \"right\" is a direction, but according to the primitive verbs listed, the only primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"run right\" isn't a primitive. Therefore, perhaps \"run right\" is parsed as \"turn right\" followed by \"run\", as per the rules. Wait, in the example, \"jump around right\" is parsed as four repetitions of [turn right then jump]. So \"around right\" is a modifier on the verb. Similarly, \"opposite right\" would be two turns right then the verb.\n\nBut in \"run right\", there's no such modifier. So maybe \"run right\" is not a valid command, but according to the problem, the user input is \"run right thrice\". How to parse this?\n\nWait, maybe the \"right\" after run is a direction, but according to the rules, unless there's a modifier like \"around\" or \"opposite\", directions after verbs are not covered. Hmm. So perhaps \"run right\" is actually a mistake, but the user provided this input, so we need to parse it. Alternatively, perhaps the \"right\" in \"run right\" is a modifier that requires turning right first. Wait, perhaps the structure is that any direction following a verb (without \"around\" or \"opposite\") would imply turning that direction before doing the verb. For example, \"run left\" would be turn left then run. Otherwise, how would you express \"run to the left\"? But the problem's rules don't state this. The problem's rules only specify the transformations for \"opposite\", \"around\", \"twice\", \"thrice\", and the sequence words \"and\", \"after\".\n\nSo maybe the direction after a verb without those modifiers is just ignored, but that can't be. Alternatively, maybe \"run right\" is parsed as \"run\" followed by \"turn right\", but that also isn't clear. Hmm. This is a problem. Let me re-examine the example given in the problem.\n\nThe example input is \"jump around right\", output is \"I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\" four times. So \"around right\" is parsed as four times [turn right + jump]. So the structure is that \"around <DIR>\" modifies the verb to be preceded by a turn in DIR each time.\n\nSimilarly, \"opposite <DIR>\" would be two turns in DIR then the verb.\n\nBut in the current case, we have \"run right\" which isn't using \"around\" or \"opposite\". So perhaps the original command \"run right\" is a typo or not a valid command. Alternatively, perhaps \"run right\" is equivalent to \"run in the right direction\", which would require turning right first. But according to the rules provided, how to parse this?\n\nWait, looking at the rules again. The first rule says that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"run right\" would be two separate verbs: run and turn right. But the input is \"run right\", which is a command that's not directly covered by the rules. Unless the \"right\" is part of the verb, which it isn't. Therefore, perhaps the correct parsing of \"run right\" is not possible under the given rules, but since the problem provides this input, we have to assume that maybe the user intended \"run\" followed by \"turn right\", or something else. Alternatively, perhaps \"run right\" is a mistake and should be \"turn right then run\". But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"run right\" is parsed as \"run\" while facing right, but the agent's orientation matters. But according to the rules, direction would be handled via the turn commands.\n\nWait, perhaps \"run right\" here is a mistake, and the user intended \"turn right\" followed by \"run\", which would be the case. But how to parse \"run right\" under the given rules?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, but the user input is as given, so we need to proceed. Let's consider that \"run right\" is part of a command that uses \"right\" as a direction, but according to the rules, only \"opposite\" and \"around\" take directions. So perhaps the \"run right\" is parsed as the verb \"run\" followed by the verb \"turn right\". But the order? Hmm. But the problem's example doesn't clarify this. This is a critical point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"run right\" is a misinput, and the correct parsing would be \"run\" and \"right\" as separate. Wait, but how? The rules don't specify.\n\nWait, perhaps \"run right\" is part of the \"run around right\" or similar. But here it's \"run right\". Hmm. Since the rules don't cover this, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the problem's rules.\n\nRule 1: primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So \"run\" is I_RUN, \"turn left\" is I_TURN_LEFT, etc. So if the input is \"run right\", the \"right\" here is a direction. But \"right\" alone is not a verb. So perhaps \"turn right\" is a verb. So \"run right\" would not be a valid phrase. Therefore, maybe the user input has a typo, and the actual intended input is \"run around right\" or \"run opposite right\", but according to the given input, it's \"run right thrice\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run right\" is a sequence of \"run\" and \"turn right\", but that seems arbitrary. Wait, but in the example, \"around right\" is part of the modifier on the verb. So perhaps \"run right\" is a mistake, but assuming that the problem's input is correct, maybe \"run right\" is supposed to be parsed as \"run\" followed by a direction, but how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb], so for a", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The initial breakdown correctly applied the grammar and transformation rules provided.

The input is \"run around left twice and look opposite right thrice\". Hmm, first, I need to parse each part according to the rules provided.\n\nStarting with \"run around left twice\". The \"around left\" part means 4 repetitions of [turn left + run]. So each cycle is I_TURN_LEFT followed by I_RUN. Since it's \"around left\", that's four times. But wait, the user said \"twice\" after that. Wait, wait, no: the structure here is \"run around left twice\". Wait, maybe \"run around left\" is one unit, which is modified by \"twice\"? Wait, no. Let me check the rules again.\n\nRule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"run around left\" would be expanding to 4 times [turn left + run]. Then \"twice\" applies to the entire sequence. Wait, no. Wait, the input is \"run around left twice and look opposite right thrice\". So the structure is: the command consists of two parts connected by \"and\". The first part is \"run around left twice\", the second part is \"look opposite right thrice\".\n\nWait, but according to the rules, \"A and B\" means do A then B. So first parse \"run around left twice\", then parse \"look opposite right thrice\", then concatenate them.\n\nLet's parse \"run around left twice\" first. Breaking this down: \"run around left\" is handled by rule 3. \"around left\" would mean 4 repetitions of [turn left + run]. Then \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. Wait, rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, but here, \"run around left\" is a compound verb. Hmm. Wait, \"run around left\" is equivalent to a verb modified by \"around left\", so when \"twice\" is added, the entire \"run around left\" would be repeated twice.\n\nWait, rule 4 says that \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. So if the phrase was \"run twice\", that would be [run, run]. But in this case, \"run\" is modified by \"around left\", so \"run around left\" is the verb-like action modified by \"around left\", then \"twice\" would repeat that entire modified verb twice. So according to rule 4, the entire \"run around left\" would be executed twice. Wait, but \"run around left\" itself is already a sequence. So first expand \"run around left\" into its components (using rule 3), then repeat that entire sequence twice.\n\nYes, because \"twice\" would apply to the verb sequence. So \"run around left\" becomes the sequence from rule 3, then repeating that twice would be multiplying that sequence by two.\n\nSimilarly, \"look opposite right thrice\". Let's parse that. First, \"look opposite right\". Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"opposite right\" would be two turns right (I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT), then the verb I_LOOK. Then \"thrice\" would repeat that entire sequence three times.\n\nWait, but \"look opposite right\" is the verb plus the modifier. So the modifier \"opposite right\" applies to the verb \"look\". Then \"thrice\" applies to the entire verb sequence. So yes, each time you do \"opposite right\" then \"look\", which is two turns right and then look. Then repeat that three times.\n\nBut wait, the \"opposite right\" is two turns right, then the verb (look). So each \"look opposite right\" would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK. Then \"thrice\" would repeat that three times.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFirst part: run around left twice.\n\nRun around left (rule 3) is 4 repetitions of [turn left + run]. So:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN repeated 4 times → each turn left and run, four times. So:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\n\nThen \"twice\" → repeat that entire sequence again. So multiply that by two:\n\nFirst four times: [turn left run] *4\n\nThen again same again: [turn left run] *4 again. So total of 8 times.\n\nWait, but wait: rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions. So \"run around left\" would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN repeated four times → 4 turns left and runs.\n\nThen \"twice\" would mean repeating that entire verb sequence twice. So the entire \"run around left\" is done twice. Which would be 4 * 2 = eight times.\n\nWait, but according to the example given in the problem statement:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times (but in the example output, it's written as four pairs, each I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP, then the last action is I_TURN_RIGHT. Wait, wait, looking at the example:\n\nExample input: jump around right\n\nOutput: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times, but the output is written as:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT (Wait, the example output shows that after the four jumps, the final turn is added?)\n\nWait, no, looking at the example:\n\nThe example output is written as \"I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\". Wait, that seems odd. Wait, the input is \"jump around right\", which according to rule 3 should be 4 repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So each repetition is I_TURN_RIGHT followed by I_JUMP, four times. So each cycle is turn and jump. So four times would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (x4)\n\nWhich would be 4 turns and 4 jumps. But in the example output, they have 4 turns and 3 jumps?\n\nWait the example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nBreaking this down:\n\nEach pair is Turn, Jump, except the last one is Turn only. Wait, that's 3 jumps and 4 turns. So that's inconsistent with the rule.\n\nWait, according to the example, the output for \"jump around right\" is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (repeat 4 times) and then the last turn right. Hmm, but that would be 4 turns and 4 jumps? Or how?\n\nWait, the example output is written as:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWhich is:\n\nTurn, Jump\n\nTurn, Jump\n\nTurn, Jump\n\nTurn\n\nSo total of 4 Turns and 3 Jumps?\n\nThat's conflicting with the rule 3, which says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition would have the turn and the verb. So four times would be four turns and four verbs.\n\nBut the example output has four turns, but three jumps. So perhaps the example is a typo? Or maybe the rule explanation is different. Wait, looking at the example again:\n\nInput: jump around right\n\nOutput: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nThe output has four I_TURN_RIGHT actions and three I_JUMP. So the first three turns are followed by a jump, then the fourth turn is alone.\n\nBut according to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is turn + verb. So four times would be:\n\n[T R, V], [T R, V], [T R, V], [T R, V]\n\nWhich would be four turns and four verbs. So in the example, four I_TURN_RIGHT and four I_JUMP. But the example output doesn't do that.\n\nHmm, so there's a discrepancy here. How to resolve this? The example output must be correct according to the rules. Wait, perhaps the rule is that \"around\" means turn, then perform the verb, repeat four times. Wait, but then how?\n\nWait, in the example output, it's:\n\nTurn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right.\n\nWhich is four turns and three jumps? Or wait, perhaps the first three turns are followed by jumps, then a final turn. That would be four turns and three jumps. But according to rule 3, each of the four repetitions includes a turn and a verb. So four turns and four verbs.\n\nSo the example output seems to be wrong. Or maybe the rule is that \"around\" is four turns and then four verbs? Or perhaps the example is a typo. But we have to follow the example's lead.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that after each turn, you do the verb, then repeat this four times, but then you end up facing the original direction. Wait, for example, turning right four times would bring you back to the original direction. So \"jump around right\" would be four times: turn right, jump, then turn right again, etc. But regardless, the example shows that after each jump, you turn again. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule for \"around\" is that you do the verb four times, each time preceded by a turn. But the example output has four turns and three jumps. That can't be. Unless the example is written with a space between each pair, but in the example output, the user wrote:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWhich", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The original command 'run around left twice and look opposite right thrice' was parsed by applying the rules methodically.

The \"around left\" part means 4 repetitions of [turn left + walk]. So that would be I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK repeated four times. Then \"thrice\" means we repeat this entire around left sequence three times. So each around left (which is 4 turns and walks) done three times.\n\nThen \"and turn around right\".

Wait, the verb here is \"turn around right\". Wait, no. Wait, \"turn around right\" – wait, the original command is \"turn around right\"? Or is it \"turn around right\"? Let me check the input again. The input is \"walk around left thrice and turn around right\". So the second part is \"turn around right\". Hmm.\n\nWait, \"turn around right\" – how to parse that. The structure is \"around <DIR>\" which would be 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Wait, but here the verb is \"turn\". Wait, \"turn around right\" would be parsed as \"around right\" applied to the verb \"turn\". Wait, no. Let me re-examine the rules. Rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the entire phrase \"turn around right\" would be interpreted as applying the \"around right\" to the verb \"turn\". Wait, but \"turn around right\" – is the verb \"turn\" and then \"around right\"? Or is \"turn around\" the verb, but that's not a primitive. Hmm. Wait, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn around right\" – wait, \"around\" is part of the command here. Wait, the input is \"turn around right\", so how to parse that. Let's split into parts. The main command here is \"turn around right\". Let's see: \"around right\" would be the modifier. So the structure is \"turn around right\", which would be parsed as per rule 3. So \"around right\" means 4 repetitions of [turn right + turn]. Wait, because the verb is \"turn\". Wait, but \"turn\" can have directions, like \"turn left\" or \"turn right\". Wait, but in the rules, the primitive verbs are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\", which map to I_TURN_LEFT and I_TURN_RIGHT. So if we have a verb \"turn\" without a direction, how is that handled? Wait, looking at the rules, rule 1 says primitive verbs are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". So \"turn\" alone isn't a primitive verb. Hmm. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Wait, the original command is \"turn around right\". Let me re-examine the input. The user wrote: \"walk around left thrice and turn around right\". So the second part is \"turn around right\". How to parse this? Maybe \"turn\" is the verb, and \"around right\" applies to it. But according to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" applies to the verb. So \"around right\" would mean 4 repetitions of [turn right + verb]. But the verb here is \"turn\", which isn't a primitive verb. Wait, unless \"turn around right\" is parsed differently. Wait, perhaps \"around right\" is the direction of the turn. But the original primitive verbs are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". So maybe \"turn around right\" is a different command. Alternatively, perhaps \"turn around\" is a verb, but according to the rules, that's not specified. This is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps \"turn around right\" is a misread. Wait, the command could be \"turn around right\" meaning that you turn around (180 degrees) by turning right twice. Because \"around\" is sometimes used as a direction. But according to the rules, \"around <DIR>\" is a repetition. Let me re-examine the rules. Rule 3 says: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the \"around\" is a modifier on the direction, which applies to the verb. So in the case of \"turn around right\", the verb is \"turn\", but \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb. The primitives are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". Therefore, perhaps \"turn around right\" is not a valid command. Wait, but the input is given, so we need to parse it. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let's parse \"turn around right\" as \"around right\" modifying the verb \"turn\". But \"turn\" isn't a valid verb in the primitive list. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo here. Wait, perhaps the user intended \"turn around right\" as \"turn right around right\"? Or perhaps \"turn around\" is the verb. Alternatively, perhaps the correct parsing is \"turn around right\" meaning \"turn around\" (but how?) Maybe the user intended \"turn around\" as a single verb, but according to the rules, that's not a primitive. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps \"turn around\" is equivalent to two turns. But given the rules, we need to stick to the primitives.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the command is \"turn around right\" meaning \"turn right around right\" which would be \"around right\" applied to the verb \"turn right\". Wait, but that's getting complicated. Let me try to parse this again. The input is \"walk around left thrice and turn around right\". The first part \"walk around left thrice\" is manageable. The second part \"turn around right\" – perhaps \"turn\" is a typo, and the intended verb is \"turn right\" or \"turn left\". Alternatively, maybe the user intended \"turn around\" as a verb, but since that's not in the rules, perhaps this is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps \"turn around right\" should be parsed as \"around right\" applied to the verb \"turn\", but \"turn\" isn't a primitive. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"turn around right\" is parsed as \"turn\" with the \"around right\" part being a modifier. But without a clear primitive verb, this is a problem. Wait, perhaps the \"turn around right\" is actually \"turn around\" followed by \"right\", but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and intended \"turn right around right\"? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"turn around right\" is parsed as \"turn\" (the verb) and \"around right\" as a direction. But since \"turn\" alone isn't a primitive, this would be invalid. Therefore, maybe there's a mistake in the input. But since this is the input we need to process, perhaps we need to make an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"turn around right\" is equivalent to \"turn right twice\" (as in turning 180 degrees). But according to the rules, \"opposite right\" would be two turns right, but \"around\" is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended \"turn around right\" as \"around right\" applied to the verb \"turn right\"? Wait, that seems possible. Wait, but how? Let's think. The original rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the verb here is \"turn right\". So \"around right\" applied to the verb \"turn right\". Then each repetition would be: turn right, then turn right. But then repeating four times. But that would be a total of 8 turns right? Not sure.\n\nBut wait, \"turn around right\" – the command is \"turn around right\". Split into \"turn\" as the verb and \"around right\" as the modifier. Then according to rule 3, \"around right\" would mean 4 repetitions of [turn right + turn]. Wait, but the verb is \"turn\". However, \"turn\" alone isn't a primitive verb.

Which would require that \"turn\" is a verb. If we proceed despite that, then each of the four repetitions would be [turn right + turn]. But \"turn\" here isn't a valid primitive. So perhaps this is a problem.

So here, \"look opposite right\" is A, and \"look around right thrice\" is B. So the order would be B first, then A.\n\nWait, wait. Wait the command is \"look opposite right after look around right thrice\". So the structure is \"A after B\", where A is \"look opposite right\" and B is \"look around right thrice\". So according to rule 6, we do B first, then A.\n\nNow, let's handle each part.\n\nStarting with B: \"look around right thrice\". Let's parse \"look around right\" first. Rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. But wait, the verb here is \"look\". However, looking isn't one of the primitive verbs listed. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left/right. Hmm. Wait, the input in the example uses \"jump around right\", so \"jump\" is a primitive verb. But in this case, \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, but the user's command uses \"look\". Wait, the initial rules state that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. The examples given are walk→I_WALK, run→I_RUN, jump→I_JUMP, turn left→I_TURN_LEFT, turn right→I_TURN_RIGHT. So \"look\" isn't listed. But the example uses \"jump around right\", which would be \"turn right and jump\" four times. So in the problem, \"look\" is a primitive verb? Or is it not?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"semantic parsing agent for navigation commands\". The primitive verbs listed are walk, run, jump, turn left/right. So perhaps \"look\" is not a primitive verb. Wait, but the user's input includes \"look opposite right after look around right thrice\". So how to handle this. Wait, the example given in the problem uses \"jump around right\" which translates to turning right and jumping four times. So \"jump\" is a primitive verb. But the current input has \"look\", which isn't in the list. Is this a problem? Maybe the user made a mistake, but I need to process it as per the rules.\n\nWait, the problem says \"look\" is part of the command, but according to the rules, only the primitive verbs listed are mapped. So perhaps \"look\" is being used as a verb here, but it's not in the initial list. Hmm, this might be an inconsistency. But according to the problem statement, maybe \"look\" is a primitive verb that maps to I_LOOK. But the rules don't mention it. Wait, the original problem's example uses \"jump around right\" which is handled as four repetitions of [turn right and jump], which suggests that the verb must be a primitive. But in the current problem, the verb is \"look\", which is not listed as a primitive. However, perhaps the problem expects us to treat \"look\" as a primitive verb. Otherwise, the input would be invalid.\n\nAssuming that \"look\" is a primitive verb, following the same pattern as others, mapping to I_LOOK. Let's proceed with that assumption, because otherwise, we can't process the command.\n\nSo B is \"look around right thrice\". First, \"look around right\" according to rule 3 would be 4 repetitions of [turn right + look]. So each cycle is I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK. So four times: I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK. Then \"thrice\" applies to the entire \"around right\" part. Wait, no: \"around right thrice\" would be the \"around\" being modified by \"thrice\"? Wait, the command is \"look around right thrice\". Wait, the structure of the command: \"around <DIR>\" is rule 3. Then \"thrice\" applies to the verb sequence. Rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions. But then \"thrice\" would mean that the entire \"around right\" sequence (which is four repetitions) is repeated thrice? Wait, no. Wait, the original input for B is \"look around right thrice\". Let's parse this.\n\nBreaking down \"look around right thrice\". The phrase \"around right\" is modified by \"look\" and \"thrice\". The structure could be \"look around right\" modified by \"thrice\". Or perhaps \"around right\" is modified by \"look\" and then \"thrice\" applies to the entire \"look around right\" sequence. So according to rule 4: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions. Then \"thrice\" would apply as repeating that entire \"around\" sequence three times. Wait, but the command is \"look around right thrice\", which could be parsed as \"look around right\" thrice. So \"look around right\" is the verb phrase, and \"thrice\" tells us to repeat that three times. Let's see:\n\nRule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. Similarly for thrice. So \"look around right\" would be the verb sequence, which itself is 4 repetitions (rule 3). Then \"thrice\" would mean that this entire sequence (the four repetitions) is done three times. Therefore, B is [ (turn right + look repeated four times ) ] three times. So that would be:\n\nEach \"look around right\" is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK repeated four times (so each of the four steps). So that's:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK\n\nThen \"thrice\" means doing that entire sequence three times. So three times the above line. So B would be that entire sequence multiplied three times.\n\nBut wait, the wording in rule 4 says \"twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if the verb sequence is \"look around right\", which itself is a compound action, then \"thrice\" would repeat that entire compound action three times. So yes.\n\nSo B is \"look around right thrice\" → repeat the \"look around right\" action three times. Each \"look around right\" is four [turn right, look] actions, so 4 x 3 = 12 actions for B.\n\nNow moving on to A: \"look opposite right\". According to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So opposite right would be two turns right, then the verb. Wait, the rule says \"two turns in DIR then the verb\". Wait, \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are their own actions, so \"turn DIR\" is a primitive verb. Wait, in the rules, \"turn left\" maps to I_TURN_LEFT. So the phrase \"two turns in DIR\" would be two I_TURN_RIGHT if DIR is right. So \"opposite right\" means two I_TURN_RIGHT, then the verb (look). So the sequence for A is: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK.\n\nWait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So the structure is two turns in the specified direction, followed by the verb. So \"look opposite right\" would be the verb (look) preceded by two turns right. But the way the rule is written: \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns DIR then the verb. So the sequence would be two turns in DIR direction, then the verb. So \"look opposite right\" would be \"opposite right\" is two turns right, then the verb \"look\". So the sequence is: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK.\n\nPutting it all together, the entire command is \"A after B\", which is B followed by A. So first perform B (\"look around right thrice\"), then perform A (\"look opposite right\").\n\nSo B is:\n\nEach \"look around right\" is four [turn right, look]. Then thrice → repeat the entire \"look around right\" three times. So:\n\nFirst \"look around right\":\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK repeated four times:\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK\n\nMultiply that by three:\n[Turn right, Look] x4 three times.\n\nSo B is:\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK \n(repeated three times in total)\n\nThen A is:\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK\n\nSo the entire output is the sequence of B followed by A.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nB first (three times the four repetitions), then A.\n\nSo the output should be:\n\nFor each of the three \"around right\" in B:\n\nFirst around right:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK repeated four times:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK\n\nSecond around right: same again.\n\nThird around right: same again.\n\nThen A:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK.\n\nPutting all together with spaces.\n\nWait, but the example shows that after each four repetitions, there's a space? Wait, the example output for \"jump around right\" is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, no. Wait the example input is \"jump around right\", output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, wait.

The input is \"jump left twice after turn left thrice\". Hmm, first, I need to parse the structure here. \n\nBreaking it down, the main clause is \"jump left twice after turn left thrice\". According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So here, A is \"jump left twice\" and B is \"turn left thrice\". So the order should be first do B (turn left thrice), then do A (jump left twice).\n\nWait, wait. Wait, \"jump left twice\" – how does that fit into the rules? Let's look at each part. \n\nFirst, \"turn left thrice\": the verb is \"turn left\", which maps to I_TURN_LEFT. Since it's \"thrice\", that means repeat three times. So that's I_TURN_LEFT three times.\n\nThen \"jump left twice\": the verb here is \"jump left\". Wait, but according to the primitive verbs, \"jump\" is I_JUMP. Wait, the command here is \"jump left\", but the rules mention that \"jump\" maps to I_JUMP. So what's \"jump left\"? Is \"jump left\" a primitive verb or is \"jump\" the verb and \"left\" is a direction? Wait, looking at the example given in the rules: the example input was \"jump around right\" which became I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times. So \"jump\" is the verb, and \"around right\" is a modifier. Similarly, in this case, \"jump left twice\" – the verb is \"jump\", modified by \"left\" and \"twice\".\n\nWait, but the rules mention that \"around <DIR>\" is a specific pattern. Also, \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. But what about \"jump left\"? The rules don't explicitly mention directional verbs except in the cases of \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". Let me check the first rule: primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. The primitive verbs listed are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn left\" is a primitive verb, mapping to I_TURN_LEFT. Similarly, \"jump\" is a primitive verb mapping to I_JUMP. So \"jump left\" is not a primitive verb. Wait, that's a problem. Because the input here is \"jump left twice after turn left thrice\".\n\nWait, how to parse \"jump left\"? The user wrote \"jump left twice\". Is \"jump left\" a single verb, or is \"jump\" the verb and \"left\" a direction? But according to the rules, the only directional verbs are turn left and turn right. So maybe \"jump left\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, this might be a problem. But the example in the rules uses \"jump around right\", where \"jump\" is the verb, and \"around right\" is a modifier. So perhaps the structure is that \"jump\" is the verb, and \"left\" here is a direction modifier. Wait, but the rules don't mention directional modifiers for verbs other than \"around\" and \"opposite\". Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the original command is ambiguous. But according to the user's instruction, we need to apply the rules strictly. Let's re-examine the problem.\n\nThe input is \"jump left twice after turn left thrice\". According to rule 6: \"A after B\" means do B then A. So here, \"jump left twice\" is A, \"turn left thrice\" is B. So first do B (turn left thrice), then A (jump left twice).\n\nNow, parsing \"turn left thrice\": the verb is \"turn left\" (primitive), so I_TURN_LEFT. \"thrice\" means repeat three times. So B becomes I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT.\n\nNow A is \"jump left twice\". How to parse that. Let's see. The verb here is \"jump\", which is a primitive verb mapped to I_JUMP. The \"left\" here may be part of a directional construct. But according to the rules, the directional constructs are \"opposite <DIR>\" and \"around <DIR>\". The \"jump left\" doesn't fit into those patterns. So maybe \"left\" here is a direction for a turn, but the verb is \"jump\". Alternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is intended to be parsed as \"jump\", but with \"left\" as a direction. Wait, but the rules don't mention that. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake here. Or perhaps there's an implicit assumption. Let me think again. The command is \"jump left twice\". Let's see possible interpretations.\n\nOption 1: \"jump\" is the verb (I_JUMP), and \"left\" is a direction modifier. But the rules don't specify how to handle directional modifiers for jump. So unless there's a rule that allows for turning left before jumping, but maybe \"jump left\" isn't covered by the given rules. That would be a problem. Alternatively, maybe the \"left\" here is a typo or misunderstanding, but given the input, we need to parse it.\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump left\" is equivalent to \"jump opposite left\", but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the \"left\" here is a direction for a turn before the jump. But according to the rules, how to parse \"jump left\"? Let's check the rules again.\n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So if the command was \"jump opposite left\", then it would be two left turns then jump. But here it's \"jump left\", not \"opposite left\".\n\nRule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So again, not applicable here.\n\nSo perhaps \"jump left\" is not a valid command under the given rules. However, the user provided this input, so maybe we need to assume that \"jump left\" is equivalent to \"jump\" (since the direction isn't part of the primitive verbs, but maybe it's a mistake). Alternatively, perhaps the \"left\" in \"jump left\" is a direction to turn first. Or maybe it's a typo and should be \"turn left jump\", but that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe the \"jump left\" is parsed as \"jump\" followed by \"left\", but \"left\" here is a direction for a turn. But that doesn't fit any of the rules. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is an error, but given the example input in the problem, the assistant is supposed to handle it somehow.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is structured such that \"jump left\" is equivalent to \"jump\" preceded by a turn left. But according to the rules, that would be covered by constructs like \"around\" or \"opposite\", but not directly. Alternatively, maybe \"jump left twice\" is parsed as \"turn left then jump twice\", but that's not according to any stated rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is a misphrasing, and the intended meaning is \"jump to the left\", which isn't covered by the given rules, so the correct parsing is to ignore the left, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe \"jump left\" is equivalent to \"jump\", and \"left\" is a modifier that's ignored. But that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects us to treat \"jump left\" as \"jump\", and the \"left\" is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe \"jump left\" is equivalent to \"jump\" with a left direction, which would require a rule not given. Hmm. This seems like a possible oversight, but since the user provided the input, we must work with the rules given.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider that \"jump left\" is parsed as a verb with direction, but according to the rules, only \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitives. So \"jump left\" would have to be parsed as \"jump\" plus some direction handling. But how?\n\nWait, unless \"jump left\" is a misapplication of the \"opposite left\" rule, but no. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended \"jump left\" to be \"turn left then jump\", but there's no rule that specifies that. Unless \"jump left\" is interpreted as \"jump after turn left\", using rule 6. But that's not how the rule works. Rule 6 is for ordering between two clauses, not for parsing a single clause.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is designed so that \"jump left\" is treated as \"turn left then jump\", but there's no explicit rule for that. Alternatively, maybe \"jump left\" is a typo for \"turn left jump\". But that's speculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"left\" in \"jump left\" is a direction modifier that requires turning left first. But according to the given rules, unless there's a rule that specifies that, we can't assume that. For example, if the command was \"opposite left jump\", then it would be two turns left then jump. But \"jump left\" isn't covered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is simply \"I_JUMP\", with the left being ignored. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump left twice\" is parsed as \"jump twice to the left\", which would be I_JUMP I_JUMP, but again, the left isn't mapped.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended \"jump left\" to be \"jump\" after \"turn left\", which would be \"turn left then jump\", but how does that fit with the rules?\n\nThis seems like a problem. The example in the rules had \"jump around right\", which expands to turning right and jumping four times. So the \"around right\" part modified the jump.

So perhaps \"look left\" here is intended to be treated as a verb, but according to the rules, the only primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Therefore, \"look left\" isn't a primitive. Hmm, this could be a problem. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake, but the problem expects us to handle it. Alternatively, maybe \"look left\" is a typo for \"turn left\". Otherwise, perhaps we need to parse it as invalid. But the problem must have a solution, so I'll assume \"look left\" is intended as \"turn left\". So \"look left\" maps to I_TURN_LEFT. Then \"look left thrice\" would be I_TURN_LEFT three times. \n\nNow, the main command is \"run thrice after look left thrice\". According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So here, A is \"run thrice\" and B is \"look left thrice\". Therefore, we first do B then A. So first \"look left thrice\" (I_TURN_LEFT thrice), then \"run thrice\" (I_RUN thrice). \n\nBut wait, the order is important. So the entire sequence would be:\n\nB: look left thrice → I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT\n\nthen A: run thrice → I_RUN I_RUN I_RUN\n\nSo the output should be I_TURN_LEFT repeated three times followed by I_RUN three times.\n\nWait, but the example for \"jump around right\" gives four turns and jumps. But that's because \"around right\" is rule 3, which is four repetitions. So that's different.\n\nBut in this problem, the command is \"run thrice after look left thrice\", which according to rule 6 becomes B then A. So the output should be the B sequence followed by the A sequence.\n\nSo putting it all together: each \"thrice\" is three repetitions. So look left thrice → I_TURN_LEFT three times. Run thrice → I_RUN three times. Therefore, the output is:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_RUN I_RUN\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"look left\" which I assumed is equivalent to \"turn left\" because that's a primitive. If \"look left\" isn't a primitive verb, then maybe it's invalid. However, given that the system must parse it, perhaps \"look left\" is treated as a separate action, but according to the rules, only the primitives are allowed. Therefore, the input \"look left\" might be a mistake, but given that the example works, perhaps the user intended \"look left\" to be \"turn left\". Alternatively, if \"look left\" is considered a different verb not in the primitives, then we can't process it. But since the problem gives that input, we need to parse it. Maybe the user intended \"look left\" as \"turn left\", so I'll proceed with that.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_RUN I_RUN", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The input command is 'run thrice after look left thrice'.

Rule 4 states that 'thrice' means repeat the sequence three times. Therefore, the correct interpretation is to perform 'I_TURN_LEFT' three times (for 'look left thrice'), followed by 'I_RUN' three times (for 'run thrice').

But wait, \"run right\" could be interpreted as running to the right direction, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs already map to actions. Wait, looking at the rules, the primitive verbs include \"run\" which maps to I_RUN. But directions like \"left\" or \"right\" only apply to turn commands. Hmm, so \"run right\" might not be a valid command because the direction isn't part of the run action. Wait, the example given in the rules doesn't have a direction for run. For instance, in the example, \"jump around right\" translates to turning right and jumping, etc. So directions for non-turn verbs are handled via the rules.\n\nWait, the user's input is \"run right and run twice\". Let me check the rules again. Rule 1 says that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions, and the examples are like \"run→I_RUN\". Directions are part of turn commands. So \"run right\" might be invalid unless there's a rule that allows directions to be attached to run. But according to the problem statement, the rules are as listed. The example \"jump around right\" uses \"around right\" which is rule 3. So perhaps \"run right\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, the user might have made a mistake, but the agent must parse according to the given rules. Wait, the input is \"run right and run twice\". Let's parse this.\n\nWait, the possible issue here is whether \"run right\" is a valid verb phrase. The primitive verbs are \"run\", \"walk\", etc., and turning directions are separate. So \"run right\" might be parsed as \"run\" with a direction, but according to the rules, direction only applies to turns. Wait, but looking at the example \"jump around right\", which uses \"right\" as part of the around command. So perhaps \"run right\" is not a valid command. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake, but according to the given problem, we need to process the command as per the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"right\" in \"run right\" is a direction, but since run doesn't take a direction, maybe it's a turn. Wait, but that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the user intended \"run right\" as a way to turn right and then run. But according to the rules, how is that handled? Let me check the rules again.\n\nRule 1: Primitive verbs map to actions. So \"run\" is I_RUN. Directions are part of the turn commands. So \"run right\" might not be a valid command. But the input is given as \"run right and run twice\". Maybe the user intended \"run\" followed by \"right\" as a direction, but that's not possible unless the run action takes a direction. Since the problem says to follow the given rules strictly, perhaps \"run right\" is invalid. But the user provided this input, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, looking at the example \"jump around right\" which maps to turning right and jumping each time. The \"around right\" is a phrase where \"around\" is a modifier with direction. Similarly, \"opposite\" and \"around\" take directions. So perhaps \"run right\" is not a standard command. Wait, unless \"run right\" is parsed as \"run\" followed by \"right\", but \"right\" alone would be a direction for a turn. But the command would need to be structured. Let's see.\n\nWait, the input is \"run right and run twice\". Breaking it down: \"run right\" and then \"run twice\". The \"and\" connects the two parts (rule 5: A and B → A then B). So \"run right\" is A, and \"run twice\" is B. So we need to parse \"run right\" first.\n\nBut how? \"run\" is a verb, \"right\" is a direction. The rules don't mention that verbs other than turn can take directions. So maybe \"run right\" is being used with \"right\" as part of a phrase. Wait, perhaps the user intended \"run right\" as \"run\" followed by \"turn right\", but that's not any of the rules. Alternatively, maybe the \"right\" is part of an \"around\" or \"opposite\" construct, but here it's not. So perhaps \"run right\" is invalid. But the problem expects us to process it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"run right\" is a mistake and should be \"turn right then run\", but the user wrote \"run right\". Alternatively, perhaps \"run\" and \"right\" are separate verbs. Wait, but the command is \"run right and run twice\", which could be parsed as two separate commands connected by \"and\".\n\nWait, perhaps \"run right\" is a misphrasing, and the intended meaning is \"run, then turn right, then run twice\". But according to the rules, how to parse \"run right\"?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended \"run\" in a direction. But according to the given rules, the actions are directionless except for the turn commands. For example, I_RUN doesn't have a direction, so to change direction, you turn, then perform the action. So \"run right\" would require turning right then running. But how does the system parse \"run right\"? Because according to the rules, there's no mention of direction for run. So perhaps \"run right\" is a misphrased command that the system can't parse, but the problem expects us to process it. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe \"run right\" is a typo and should be \"turn right and run\", but given the input, we need to parse it as per the rules. Alternatively, perhaps \"run right\" is treated as \"run\" followed by \"right\" as a noun, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe \"run right\" is parsed as a verb phrase where \"right\" is an adverb, but according to the rules, direction modifiers apply only to the constructs like around, opposite, and turn. Therefore, \"run right\" may be invalid. However, the user provided this input, so perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nWait, looking back at the example: \"jump around right\" becomes 4 repetitions of turn right + jump. So \"around right\" is a modifier. Similarly, \"run right\" could be a direction modifier, but since \"around\" and \"opposite\" are the only modifiers that take directions. So \"run\" by itself can't take a direction. Therefore, \"run right\" may be invalid, but perhaps the system interprets it as \"run\" followed by \"turn right\". But according to the rules, how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"run right\" is a mistake, and the correct parsing is \"run\" and \"right\" as separate, but \"right\" is a turn. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the input is ambiguous, but according to the given rules, the correct way would be to parse \"run\" as a verb and \"right\" as a direction. But since the verb doesn't take a direction, maybe the \"right\" is a separate command. Wait, but the command is \"run right and run twice\". The \"run right\" part could be \"run\" followed by \"right\" (turn right), then \"run twice\".\n\nBut according to the rules, how would that be structured? Let's see:\n\nBreaking down \"run right and run twice\":\n\nIf \"run right\" is parsed as \"run\" and \"turn right\", then according to rule 5, \"run right\" (run and turn right?) No, because \"and\" connects two parts. Wait, no: the structure is \"A and B\", where A is \"run right\" and B is \"run twice\". But how to parse \"run right\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"run right\" is a typo for \"turn right and run\", but that's speculation. Alternatively, perhaps \"run right\" is interpreted as \"run\" in the right direction, which according to the rules would require turning right first. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the user might have intended \"run after turning right\", which would require \"turn right then run\". If \"run right\" is intended as that, then it would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN. But according to the given rules, is there a way to represent that? The rules don't explicitly state that a direction after a verb implies a turn. So maybe the user made a mistake here. But given that the problem is presented, perhaps we need to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run right\" is a misphrasing and the correct command should be \"turn right and run\", which would be parsed as run comes after turning. But in the absence of such a rule, perhaps the system doesn't recognize \"run right\" and would output an error. However, the problem expects us to provide an action sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"right\" here is a mistake, and the intended command was \"run around right\" or something else. But given the input, we need to work with it.\n\nWait, perhaps \"run right\" is simply \"run\" followed by the direction word, which is ignored, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the \"right\" is a mistake and should be omitted, leading to two runs. But that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is structured such that \"run right\" is parsed as \"run\" and then \"right\" as a direction in a way not covered by the rules. But the rules don't account for that, so perhaps the correct parsing is to ignore the \"", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 90, "model_reflection": "The original interpretation of 'run right' as 'I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT' assumes that 'right' is a turn action following the run, which is a reasonable interpretation given the ambiguity and the lack of explicit structure in the input.

The input is \"run twice after jump opposite left twice\". Hmm, first, I need to parse the structure. The main structure here is \"run twice after jump opposite left twice\". Wait, the \"after\" rule says that \"A after B\" means B then A. So the entire command is \"run twice\" after \"jump opposite left twice\". So first, I need to process the \"jump opposite left twice\" part, then the \"run twice\" part.\n\nLet's break down \"jump opposite left twice\". The \"opposite left\" means two turns in the left direction. According to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"opposite left\" would be two left turns (I_TURN_LEFT twice), then the verb, which is jump. But wait, the \"twice\" here applies to the entire \"jump opposite left\" sequence, right? Wait, the phrasing is \"jump opposite left twice\". The \"twice\" probably applies to the entire action. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the command is \"jump opposite left twice\". So \"twice\" applies to the entire \"jump opposite left\". So according to rule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"jump opposite left twice\" would mean doing \"jump opposite left\" two times. But wait, maybe the structure is \"jump opposite left\" twice. But how to parse \"opposite left twice\"? Hmm, maybe not. Let's re-examine.\n\nWait, the original part is \"jump opposite left twice\". The \"opposite left\" is a single action. Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" becomes two turns in DIR, then the verb. So \"jump opposite left\" would be \"opposite left\" (two left turns) then jump. But then \"twice\" would apply to that entire action. So \"jump opposite left twice\" is doing that sequence (two left turns, jump) twice. But wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" uses four repetitions, but here \"twice\" would mean repeating the sequence twice. So for \"jump opposite left twice\", we have two instances of the sequence: each time, two left turns, then a jump. So each \"jump opposite left\" is two turns left and a jump. Then twice would be doing that two times.\n\nSo \"jump opposite left twice\" would translate to:\n\nFirst iteration: I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nSecond iteration: I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nSo the entire sequence for \"jump opposite left twice\" is I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nWait, but according to rule 2, the \"opposite left\" would be two turns left, then the verb. So the verb here is jump. So each time, you do two left turns, then jump. So yes, each \"jump opposite left\" is two left turns and a jump. Then twice means doing this twice. So that's two times that sequence.\n\nThen, the other part is \"run twice after\" which is the \"run twice\" part. But because of the \"after\", we need to do the \"jump opposite left twice\" first, then \"run twice\".\n\nSo \"run twice\" would be running twice. According to rule 4, \"run twice\" is just I_RUN I_RUN.\n\nPutting it all together: the entire sequence would be the \"jump opposite left twice\" sequence followed by \"run twice\".\n\nWait, wait. Wait the original command is \"run twice after jump opposite left twice\". So \"run twice\" is A, and \"jump opposite left twice\" is B. Since it's \"A after B\", the order is B then A.\n\nSo first process B: jump opposite left twice, then process A: run twice.\n\nSo B is:\n\nFor each \"jump opposite left twice\", we have two times (two left turns, jump). So:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (first time)\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (second time)\n\nThen A is run twice: I_RUN I_RUN.\n\nSo the entire sequence is:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_RUN I_RUN\n\nWait, but wait, in the \"jump opposite left twice\" part, each jump opposite left is done twice. So each time, two lefts and a jump. So two times that sequence.\n\nThen after that, run twice.\n\nSo the total sequence would be:\n\nJump part: two left turns, jump, two left turns, jump.\n\nThen run twice: run, run.\n\nSo combining all:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_RUN I_RUN\n\nBut wait, the example in the problem statement for \"jump around right\" gives a sequence with four jumps, each after a turn right. So \"around right\" is four repetitions of [turn right + jump], so each turn right followed by a jump. So four times.\n\nSo in our case, the \"opposite left\" would be two left turns, then the jump. So each time, two lefts, then a jump. So each \"jump opposite left\" is two turns left, jump. Then \"twice\" would be doing that twice.\n\nBut wait, could there be confusion in the phrasing? Let's check again.\n\nOriginal command: \"run twice after jump opposite left twice\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nThe command is \"run twice after (jump opposite left twice)\".\n\nSo the \"jump opposite left twice\" is a single action that is performed twice. Wait, but the \"twice\" is attached to \"jump opposite left\" or to the entire \"jump opposite left twice\"? Probably, the structure is that \"jump opposite left\" is modified by \"twice\" to mean repeat that entire action twice. So \"jump opposite left\" is the action, then \"twice\" means do it twice.\n\nSo each \"jump opposite left\" is two left turns, then a jump. Then twice would mean doing that two times. So each time, two lefts and a jump. Then two times that.\n\nSo the first part would be:\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nSecond iteration:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nThen the second part \"run twice\" is I_RUN I_RUN.\n\nCombined, the entire sequence is:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_RUN I_RUN\n\nWait, but in the example given, \"jump around right\" becomes four repetitions of [turn right + jump], which would be four turns right followed by jumps. So each repetition is turn right then jump. So four times. So the structure is [turn dir + verb] repeated n times.\n\nSimilarly, \"opposite left\" is two turns left then the verb.\n\nNow, the \"jump opposite left twice\" would be:\n\nEach \"opposite left\" is two left turns, then the verb (jump). Then \"twice\" would mean that the entire sequence (two lefts, jump) is done twice.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo that's two times (two lefts, jump), so each time two lefts and a jump. So the first time:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nSecond time:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nSo concatenated, they are:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nThen the \"run twice\" part:\n\nI_RUN I_RUN\n\nSo overall, the entire action sequence is:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_RUN I_RUN\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait the user input is \"jump opposite left twice\". The \"twice\" could be applied to the \"jump opposite left\" phrase. So perhaps the parsing is correct.\n\nBut also, could there be a different interpretation? For example, \"jump opposite left twice\" could be interpreted as \"jump opposite left twice\" as in \"twice\" modifying the entire jump and opposite left. Hmm, but according to the rules, \"verb twice\" is repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, the rule says: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if the verb sequence is \"jump opposite left\", then \"twice\" would repeat that sequence twice.\n\nBut how to parse \"jump opposite left twice\". The verb phrase here is \"jump opposite left\", which is a verb (jump) with a direction modifier (opposite left). Then \"twice\" would repeat that entire verb phrase twice. So each time, \"jump opposite left\" would be two left turns then jump, and doing that twice.\n\nSo the same as above.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nThen after that, we have \"run twice\" which is I_RUN I_RUN.\n\nPutting it all together, the final output should be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_RUN I_RUN\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, the \"run twice\" part: according to the rules, \"run twice\" is I_RUN I_RUN. Correct.\n\nBut in the example, \"jump around right\" becomes four jumps and four turns. So each turn right followed by a jump, four times.\n\nSo the structure for \"around\" is four repetitions of [turn dir + verb], so each turn is followed by the action.\n\nBut in \"opposite\", the two turns are done first, then the verb. So \"opposite left\" is two left turns, then the verb.\n\nTherefore, the processing for \"jump opposite left twice\" is indeed two left turns, jump, repeated twice.\n\nSo the entire sequence would be as above.\n\nBut wait, wait.

This suggests that perhaps the original command \"turn opposite left\" should be considered as \"turn\" being the verb, and \"opposite left\" modifying it. So applying rule 2: \"opposite left\" → two left turns then the verb. The verb here is \"turn\". But \"turn\" needs a direction. This is confusing.  \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"turn opposite left\" is a command to turn in the opposite direction of left, i.e., right. So \"turn opposite left\" would be \"turn right\". But according to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. So if the verb is \"turn\" with direction \"opposite left\", then the verb would be preceded by two left turns. Wait, perhaps the command \"turn opposite left thrice\" is parsed as follows: \"opposite left\" modifies \"turn\", so according to rule 2, it's two left turns followed by the verb. Since the verb is \"turn\", but without a direction. Hmm. Maybe this is a mistake in the problem, but the intended parsing is that \"turn opposite left\" equals two left turns. Because \"turn\" is the verb, and \"opposite left\" would require two left turns then the verb. But the verb \"turn\" would need a direction. This seems broken.  \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"turn opposite left\" is equivalent to \"turn left twice\", which would be two I_TURN_LEFT actions. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeating that twice. Wait, but the command says \"turn opposite left thrice\". So if \"opposite left\" equals two left turns, then \"turn opposite left\" is two left turns. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeating that three times. So each time two left turns, and doing that thrice. So total of 6 left turns? But that seems odd. But according to rule 2, \"opposite left\" equals two left turns followed by the verb. Wait, the verb here is \"turn\", so two left turns then \"turn\". But turn what direction? Maybe the final \"turn\" is missing a direction. This is a problem in the command parsing.  \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"turn\" is a mistake and the intended command for the second part is \"turn around right thrice\" or similar. However, given the original input, I need to proceed.  \n\nAssuming that \"turn opposite left\" is parsed as two left turns, then turn in the opposite direction (right). But this is unclear. Alternatively, perhaps \"turn opposite left\" is equivalent to turning right. Then \"turn opposite left thrice\" would be three right turns.  \n\nBut according to the rules, \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So if the phrase is \"jump opposite left\", that would be two left turns then jump. So applying this to \"turn opposite left\": the verb is \"turn\" (but direction is missing). Maybe the \"turn\" in \"turn opposite left\" is the verb, and \"opposite left\" is the direction. But this is not covered in the rules.  \n\nThis part is ambiguous, but perhaps the intended interpretation is that \"turn opposite left\" means two left turns. Because the verb is \"turn\" with no direction, but the \"opposite left\" is the modifier. Alternatively, according to rule 2: \"opposite left\" is two left turns, then the verb. The verb here is \"turn\", which would require a direction. But that's not present. This seems like a problem.  \n\nPerhaps the \"turn opposite left\" is parsed as \"turn\" in the opposite direction of left (i.e., right), so \"turn right\". And \"thrice\" would apply to that. But then why not say \"turn right thrice\"? Alternatively, maybe \"turn opposite left\" is two left turns. So each \"turn opposite left\" is two left turns, and \"thrice\" would mean doing that three times. So each time two left turns, done thrice: 2 * 3 = 6 left turns.  \n\nBut according to rule 2, it's two turns in DIR then the verb. So the verb must be a primitive verb. So if the command is \"turn opposite left\", then the \"opposite left\" modifier applies to the verb. But the verb is \"turn\", which requires a direction. But \"turn\" alone is not a primitive verb. Wait, the primitive verbs include turn left and turn right. So \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, the command \"turn opposite left\" may be invalid, but according to the problem statement, it's part of the input.  \n\nWait, the primitive verbs are: turn left→I_TURN_LEFT, turn right→I_TURN_RIGHT. So any \"turn\" must be accompanied by a direction. So \"turn opposite left\" must be parsed into a sequence of primitive verbs.  \n\nSo applying rule 2: \"opposite left\" → two left turns then the verb. But the verb here is \"turn\" (but direction not specified). Alternatively, perhaps the \"turn\" is part of the opposite processing. Maybe the intended meaning is that \"turn opposite left\" would be two left turns (as per rule 2, with no verb). But the rule says \"opposite <DIR> = two turns in DIR then the verb\". So the verb would be the original action. So for example, in the example \"jump around right\", the verb is jump.  \n\nWait, in rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So the entire phrase \"opposite <DIR>\" modifies a verb. So \"jump opposite right\" would be two right turns followed by a jump. Similarly, \"turn left opposite right\" would be ... no. Wait, in this problem, the input is \"turn opposite left thrice\". The verb here is \"turn\", but modified by \"opposite left\". But \"turn\" must have a direction. Therefore, this suggests that the correct parsing would be \"turn\" modified by \"opposite left\", but the primitive verbs are only for turn left/right.  \n\nThis seems like a contradiction. Perhaps the intended parsing is that \"turn opposite left\" is equivalent to two left turns followed by a turn (direction?). But given the confusion, perhaps the intended interpretation for \"turn opposite left\" is two left turns plus a turn in the DIR's opposite. But I'll have to make an assumption here.  \n\nLet me try again. According to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So the structure is two turns in DIR, then perform the verb. So for example, \"run opposite left\" would be two left turns, then run.  \n\nIn the case of \"turn opposite left\", the verb is \"turn\", which must have a direction. So \"turn opposite left\" would mean two left turns, then turn (direction missing). But the actual primitive verbs are turn left/right. Therefore, perhaps the intended parsing is that \"turn opposite left\" would be two left turns followed by a turn in the opposite direction. But this is speculative.  \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"turn opposite left\" is parsed as \"turn\" modified by \"opposite left\", which would be two left turns, then turn. But turn what? This is unclear. However, given that the output must be a sequence of primitive actions (I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_RIGHT, etc.), perhaps \"turn opposite left\" is two left turns. Because the verb is \"turn\", but direction is missing. So maybe the verb part is ignored, and \"opposite left\" just means two left turns. Then \"turn opposite left thrice\" would be \"turn opposite left\" three times, each consisting of two turns left. So each \"opposite left\" is two turns left, repeated thrice: 2 * 3 = 6 I_TURN_LEFT actions.  \n\nBut according to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. So the verb should be executed after the two turns. So if the command is \"turn opposite left thrice\", the verb is \"turn\" (but direction?), but following rule 2, each \"opposite left\" is two left turns then the verb. Since the verb here is \"turn\", which must have a direction. This seems broken, but perhaps the intended parsing is that \"turn\" is replaced with the opposite direction. For example, \"turn opposite left\" would be turning right, so I_TURN_RIGHT. Then \"thrice\" would mean three times. But this would make \"turn opposite left thrice\" into three I_TURN_RIGHT. However, according to rule 2, this would not align.  \n\nThis is a tricky part. Given time constraints, I'll proceed with the following assumptions:  \n\nFor \"run around left thrice\":  \n- Each \"run around left\" is 4 repetitions of [turn left, run] (rule 3).  \n- \"thrice\" means repeat that entire sequence three times.  \nSo each around left is 4 [turn left run] pairs, repeated thrice: 4*3 = 12 pairs. So 12 I_TURN_LEFT followed by I_RUN each time.  \n\nFor \"turn opposite left thrice\":  \nAssuming the verb is \"turn\", modified by \"opposite left\". According to rule 2: each \"opposite left\" is two left turns then the verb. Since the verb is \"turn\", but needs direction, perhaps it's a typo and the intended verb is \"turn\" in the opposite direction. But since the primitive verbs don't include a general turn, perhaps the correct parsing is that \"turn opposite left\" means two left turns followed by a turn in the DIR direction. Not sure. Alternatively, if \"turn opposite left\" is parsed as \"turn\" in the opposite direction of left (i.e., right), then \"turn right\". Then \"thrice\" would mean doing \"turn right\" three times. But \"turn right\" is a primitive verb. So three I_TURN_RIGHT.  \n\nBut according to rule 2, \"opposite left\" would mean two left turns then the verb. If the verb is \"turn right\", no. Alternatively, the original command is \"turn opposite left\", so the verb is \"turn\". So two left turns then the verb \"turn\". But \"turn\" requires a direction. This is unclear.  \n\nAnother approach: \"turn opposite left\" is parsed as the verb \"turn\" with direction \"opposite left\", but according to rule 2, this would be two left turns, then turn. But turn which way? Perhaps the \"turn\" is redundant, and we just take two left turns. Then \"turn opposite left\" is two left turns. \"Thrice\" would mean doing this three times. So each \"turn opposite left\" is two left turns, done thrice: 2*3=6 I_TURN_LEFT.  \n\nPutting it all together:  \n\nFirst part: run around left thrice  \nEach \"run around left\" is 4 [turn left run], repeated thrice:  \n(4 * [I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN]) repeated thrice.  \nWhich is 12 I_TURN_LEFT and 12 I_RUN in alternating sequence.  \n\nSecond part: turn opposite left thrice  \nAssuming each \"turn opposite left\" is two I_TURN_LEFT, thrice means 3 times two = 6 I_TURN_LEFT.  \n\nCombined output:  \nFirst part actions followed by second part actions.  \n\nSo the final sequence would be:  \n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN repeated 4 times, done thrice. Then I_TURN_LEFT repeated 6 times.  \n\nBreaking it down:  \n\nrun around left → 4 repetitions of [turn left run]  \nrun around left thrice → 3 * that sequence  \nturn opposite left thrice → 3 * (two left turns)  \n\nThus:  \n\nFor first part:  \n[ I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN ] * 4 * 3 = 12 turns left and 12 runs.  \n\nSecond part:  \n[ I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT ] * 3 = 6 turns left.  \n\nPutting it all together:  \n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN (run around left once)  \nRepeated thrice. Then thrice two left turns.  \n\nSo the full action sequence:  \n\n[I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN] *4 thrice → 12 pairs  \nfollowed by [I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT] thrice → 6 turns left.  \n\nNow, writing this all out:  \n\nFor the first part:  \nEach \"run around left\" is 4 pairs:  \nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN repeated 4 times.  \nDoing that thrice:  \n\n[ I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN ] repeated 4 times = run around left.  \nThrice means this entire sequence repeated thrice.  \nSo 3 * 4 = 12 [ I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN ] pairs.  \n\nWait, no. Wait, rule 4 says: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice.  \nSo \"run around left\" is a verb sequence. \"run around left thrice\" means repeat that verb thrice. So the entire \"run around left\" sequence is done three times.  \n\nBut \"run around left\" is itself 4 repetitions of [turn left run]. So doing that thrice would be 4 * 3 = 12 repetitions of [turn left run].  \n\nNo, wait. If \"run around left\" is the verb, then \"run around left thrice\" is three times that verb. Each verb instance is the around left (4 [turn left run]). So yes, 3 * 4 pairs.  \n\nThen \"turn opposite left thrice\": each \"turn opposite left\" is two left turns (rule 2), and thrice repeats this three times.  \n\nSo the output is:  \n\nFirst part:  \n( I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN ) repeated 12 times? No, wait:  \n\nrun around left is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. DIR is left, verb is run. So each around left is: turn left run turn left run turn left run turn left run. No: four repetitions of [turn left run]. Each repetition is turn DIR then verb. So four times:  \n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN  \nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN  \nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN  \nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN  \n\nThat's four times. Then \"run around left thrice\" means this entire sequence repeated three times. So 4 * 3 = 12 pairs. But wait, no. Rule 4 says repeating the verb sequence thrice. So each verb sequence is the around left (which itself is four repetitions). So \"run around left thrice\" would be three times the around left sequence. So each around left is four [turn left run], so three times that sequence. So the first part has 3 * 4 = 12 [turn run] pairs, but grouped as three blocks of four.  \n\nSo the first part is:  \n\n[ I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN ] repeated 4 times, done three times. So total 12 pairs.  \n\nThe second part is \"turn opposite left thrice\". According to rule 2: opposite left is two turns left then verb. Here, the verb is \"turn\", but direction missing. But given that the primitive verbs are turn left/right, perhaps the verb \"turn\" is invalid. But assuming that the verb is \"turn left\" or similar. Alternatively, if the command is \"turn opposite left\", the verb is \"turn\" and the opposite left modifies direction to right.  \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"turn opposite left\" is parsed as \"turn\" in the opposite direction of left, which is right → I_TURN_RIGHT. Then \"turn opposite left thrice\" is \"turn right\" thrice, repeated three times. So three I_TURN_RIGHT.  \n\nGiven the confusion, and the example given in the problem statement, where \"jump around right\" becomes four turns right and jumps, the most plausible assumption is that \"turn opposite left\" is parsed as follows:  \n\n\"opposite left\" applies to the verb \"turn\". According to rule 2, this would be two left turns, then the verb \"turn\". But the verb \"turn\" needs a direction. This seems invalid. But if we ignore the verb part, then \"turn opposite left\" would be two left turns. Then \"thrice\" → repeated three times, totaling six left turns.  \n\nAlternatively, the \"turn\" is a mistake and the intended command was \"run opposite left\", but given the input, we must proceed.  \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following:  \n\nFirst part:  \nrun around left thrice: 3 repetitions of (4 [turn left run]) → 12 [turn run pairs]  \n\nSecond part: turn opposite left thrice:  \neach \"turn opposite left\" is two turns left then turn. Since the verb is \"turn\", which is not a primitive verb. But assuming \"turn\" is \"turn left\", but this is speculative. Alternatively, the verb is missing and only the two left turns are used.  \n\nAssuming \"turn opposite left\" is two left turns, thrice means ×3: 6 left turns.  \n\nCombined output:  \n\nFor the first part:  \n3 times (4 times [turn left run]) → 12 each of turn left and run.  \n\nSequence for first part:  \n(I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN ) repeated 12 times? No, wait, each around left is four [turn and run], so 4 pairs. Then thrice: 4 × 3 = 12 pairs.  \n\nSo first part:  \nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN repeated 12 times? No: each run around left is four [turn, run], and thrice repeats that thrice.  \n\nThe actual sequence is:  \n\nFor one \"run around left\":  \nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN  \n\nThrice: repeat this three times.  \n\nSecond part: each \"turn opposite left\" is two left turns. Thrice: repeated three times.  \n\nSequence:  \nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT thrice.  \n\nSo combining all together:  \n\nFirst part:  \n[I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN] repeated 4 times, done thrice.  \nSecond part:  \n[I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT] repeated thrice.  \n\nFinal output:  \n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN repeated 4 times, done thrice, then I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT thrice.  \n\nWriting all out:  \n\nFirst around left thrice:  \n\nFor each of three times:  \nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN  \n\nSo three times that sequence.  \n\nThen the second part:  \nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT  \n\nPutting it all together:  \n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN (run around left once)  \nRepeat this entire sequence two more times (total thrice).  \nThen add six I_TURN_LEFT.  \n\nSo the final output is:  \n\nFor the first part:  \n[I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN] repeated 4 times, three times over.  \nWhich would be:  \n(I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN){4} (I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN){4} (I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN){4}  \n\nBut written sequentially:  \n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN  \nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN  \nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN  \n\nThen the second part:  \nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT repeated thrice:  \nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT  \n\nCombined output:  \n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN repeated thrice, then six I_TURN_LEFT.  \n\nNow, writing this all out in order:  \n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN  \n(repeats two more times)  \nThen six I_TURN_LEFT.  \n\nSo the final output sequence:  \n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN  \nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN  \nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN  \nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT  \n\nWith spaces between all actions.  \n\nFinal check:  \n- run around left thrice: 3 * 4 turns left and runs each  \n- turn opposite left thrice: 3 * 2 turns left = 6 turns left  \n\nTotal actions: 3*4*2 =24 (turn/run) pairs, plus 6 turns left.  \n\nSo the final output is:  \n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN repeated 12 times (but in groups of 8 actions each for each around left), followed by six I_TURN_LEFT.  \n\nBut in the required format, spaces between each action.  \n\nFinal answer:  \n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT", "model_reasoning": "Okay, let's break down the command step by step. The input is \"run around left thrice and turn opposite left thrice\". I need to parse this into actions according to the given rules.\n\nFirst, let's split the command into parts. The main structure is \"A and B\", where A is \"run around left thrice\" and B is \"turn opposite left thrice\". According to rule 5, \"A and B\" means do A then B in order. So I need to process each part separately and then concatenate them.\n\nStarting with \"run around left thrice\". The \"around left\" part refers to rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb is \"run\", so each repetition is a turn left followed by a run. But since it's \"around left thrice\", wait, wait. Wait, the command says \"run around left thrice\". The \"around left\" is the direction part. Wait, the original rule says \"around <DIR>\" means 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. But in the example given, \"jump around right\" becomes four turns right and jumps each time. So here, \"run around left\" would be 4 times [turn left, run]. Then \"thrice\" applies to that entire sequence. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the structure here is \"run around left thrice\". Let me parse this. Is \"around left\" part of the verb, and \"thrice\" applies to it? According to the rules, \"around <DIR>\" is rule 3. So \"run around left\" would be handled as per rule 3: four repetitions of turn left then run. Then \"thrice\" would mean that this entire sequence is repeated three times. Wait, no. Wait, the \"around left\" is the action, and \"thrice\" applies to the entire \"run around left\". Hmm. Let's clarify. Rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"run around left thrice\" would be the sequence for \"run around left\" repeated three times. Wait, but \"run around left\" itself is a verb phrase. So first, parse \"run around left\". According to rule 3, \"run around left\" would be 4 repetitions of [turn left + run]. Then \"thrice\" would mean that this entire sequence (each around left step) is done three times? Or wait, maybe \"around left thrice\"? Wait, no. The original command is \"run around left thrice and ...\". The \"run around left\" is modified by \"thrice\". So \"run around left thrice\" means that the entire \"run around left\" action is done three times. Wait, but according to rule 4, \"verb twice\" repeats the verb sequence. So \"run around left\" is a verb phrase, but \"around left\" is a modifier. Hmm, perhaps I should parse \"run around left\" first. Let's see: \"run around left\" would be according to rule 3. So \"around left\" means 4 repetitions of [turn left, run]. Therefore, the action for \"run around left\" is [turn left, run] repeated 4 times. Then \"thrice\" applies to that entire sequence. Wait, but rule 4 says \"verb twice\" repeats the verb sequence. But in this case, the verb is \"run around left\", which is a composite action. So \"run around left thrice\" would mean doing the entire \"run around left\" three times. Each \"run around left\" is 4 repetitions of [turn left, run]. So each around left requires four turns and runs. Then doing that three times would be 3 * 4 * 2 actions. Wait, but perhaps not. Let's think again. Rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"run around left\" is equivalent to:\n\nturn left run turn left run turn left run turn left run\n\nWait, no: four repetitions of [turn left then run]. So each repetition is first the turn, then the verb. So four times: turn left, run; turn left, run; etc. So the sequence is I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN (four times). Then \"thrice\" would mean this entire sequence is repeated three times. Wait, no. Wait, the \"run around left\" is a single verb phrase modified by \"around left\". Then \"run around left thrice\" would be the same verb sequence as \"run around left\" done thrice. But according to rule 4, \"verb twice\" is repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"run around left\" is a verb sequence that itself is a composite action. So \"run around left thrice\" would be three copies of the run around left sequence. Therefore, each \"run around left\" is four [turn left + run], so three times that would be 3 * four [turn left + run], so 12 repetitions of [turn left run], leading to 12 turns left and 12 runs? No, wait, each \"run around left\" is four [turn left + run], so doing it thrice would be 4 * 3 = 12 [turn left run] pairs. Wait, but according to rule 4, \"verb twice\" repeats the verb sequence. So if the verb is \"run around left\", then \"run around left thrice\" would be three times the verb sequence. So the verb sequence here is \"run around left\" (which is four [turn left run] steps), so repeating that thrice would multiply by 3. So the total would be:\n\n[run around left] three times = 3 times the 4 [turn left run] steps.\n\nSo each run around left is four [turn left run], so three times would be four repeated thrice. Wait, no. Wait, the original \"run around left\" is four [turn left run] steps. Then \"run around left thrice\" would be that entire sequence three times. So each run around left is four steps, so three times would be 12 [turn left run] pairs. But then the other part is \"turn opposite left thrice\". Let's parse that.\n\nThe second part of the command is \"turn opposite left thrice\". Wait, the command is \"run around left thrice and turn opposite left thrice\". So part B is \"turn opposite left thrice\".\n\n\"opposite left\" refers to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no. Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no, wait. Wait, rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no. Wait, the wording is: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, does this mean that to perform opposite direction, you do two turns in the given DIR, then perform the verb? For example, if someone says \"jump opposite left\", that would be two left turns (each 90 degrees, so total 180 degrees), then jump. So in the current case, \"turn opposite left\" would be \"turn left twice then turn left again? Wait, no. Let's parse \"turn opposite left\". The verb is \"turn\", and \"opposite left\" is the modifier. Wait, but according to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" would be a verb phrase. Wait, the example in the problem statement says that \"jump around right\" becomes the four turns and jumps. Now, for the current problem, the second part is \"turn opposite left thrice\". Let's parse \"turn opposite left\". But according to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" is equivalent to two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, perhaps the correct way is: if you have \"opposite <DIR>\", then you have to do two turns in DIR, then do the verb. Wait, but in this case, the verb is \"turn\". Hmm, this is confusing. Let's think.\n\nThe command is \"turn opposite left thrice\". Let me parse \"opposite left\" first. According to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, the verb here would be whatever action the phrase is. Wait, the original rule 2 says that \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, perhaps \"opposite <DIR>\" modifies a verb, so that when you have a verb phrase like \"jump opposite left\", it would be two turns in DIR (left) then jump. But here, the verb is \"turn\". Hmm, but \"turn opposite left\" would be a verb phrase. Wait, but \"turn opposite left\" may not be a standard command. Wait, the command is \"turn opposite left thrice\". Let's break this down.\n\nThe phrase is \"turn opposite left\". According to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So if the verb is \"turn\", then \"turn opposite left\" would be two turns left, then the verb \"turn\". Wait, but that seems odd. Or perhaps \"turn opposite left\" is equivalent to turning in the opposite direction of left. Which would be right. But according to the rule, \"opposite left\" would require two left turns (since each turn left is 90 degrees, two would result in 180 degrees, which is opposite), and then the verb. Wait,", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 75, "model_reflection": "The parsing of 'turn opposite left' was ambiguous due to the lack of explicit direction for the verb 'turn'. However, based on rule 2, 'opposite left' implies two left turns followed by the verb.

This aligns with the structure of other commands and the need to produce only primitive actions.

The input is \"jump after jump opposite left thrice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the structure. The phrase \"jump after jump opposite left thrice\" seems a bit complex. Let's split it into parts based on the rules. \n\nThe \"after\" operator means the order is reversed. So \"A after B\" translates to B then A. Here, the main structure is \"jump after (jump opposite left thrice)\". Wait, no, maybe it's \"jump after jump opposite left\" thrice? Hmm, maybe I should parse it as \"jump after jump opposite left\" and then \"thrice\" applies to that entire phrase. Wait, no, the \"thrice\" is at the end, so it's \"opposite left thrice\". Wait, the input is \"jump after jump opposite left thrice\". Let me parse the hierarchy.\n\nThe phrase is \"jump after (jump opposite left thrice)\". Or is \"jump opposite left\" the phrase that's modified by \"thrice\", and then \"jump after\" that? Let's see. The structure of the command is:\n\nThe main verb is \"jump after\", and the other part is \"jump opposite left thrice\". Wait, but \"jump opposite left thrice\" would be parsed as \"opposite left\" followed by jumping three times? No, wait the \"opposite left\" is a direction modifier. Let me re-express the command.\n\nRule 2: opposite <DIR> is two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"jump opposite left\" would be turn left twice, then jump. Then \"thrice\" applies to that entire action. Then the \"after\" operator says that the first jump comes after that entire sequence.\n\nWait, the input is \"jump after jump opposite left thrice\". Let's parse this from the inside out.\n\nThe phrase \"jump opposite left thrice\" first. Let's see: \"opposite left\" is two turns left, then jump. But \"thrice\" applies to that entire action. So \"jump opposite left thrice\" would be \"opposite left\" (two left turns and a jump) done thrice? Wait, no. Wait, the \"opposite left\" is a single direction modifier for the jump. Then \"thrice\" applies to the entire \"jump opposite left\". So \"jump opposite left\" is a single action, and \"thrice\" means repeat that three times. Wait, but how does \"opposite left\" work? According to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" translates to two turns in DIR followed by the verb. So \"jump opposite left\" would be equivalent to: turn left, turn left, jump. Because opposite left is two turns in left direction (which makes you face the opposite direction), then jump.\n\nThen \"jump opposite left thrice\" would be doing that entire action three times. Wait, but rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of turn and verb, but here, \"thrice\" applies to the verb. Rule 4 is about \"around\", which is different. Rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" = repeat [turn DIR + verb] four times. So in this case, \"jump opposite left thrice\" would be: (turn left, turn left, jump) done three times? Wait, no. Wait, the \"opposite left\" is a modifier of the jump. So each time you do the jump, you do two left turns first, then the jump. So if you have \"jump opposite left thrice\", then it's three times the sequence of two left turns and a jump. Wait, but according to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"jump opposite left\" is equivalent to: turn left, turn left, jump. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeat that sequence three times. So three times: turn left, turn left, jump. Then each of those three times.\n\nBut wait, \"jump opposite left thrice\" is \"jump opposite left\" done thrice. So yes, each time you do the opposite left (two left turns) then jump. So three times that entire action. So the sequence would be: turn left, turn left, jump, turn left, turn left, jump, turn left, turn left, jump.\n\nNow, the main command is \"jump after jump opposite left thrice\". Which translates to \"jump after [jump opposite left thrice]\". According to rule 6: \"A after B\" = B then A. So the first part, \"jump\", is A, and the second part \"[jump opposite left thrice]\" is B. So the order is B then A. Therefore, we first do the three times opposite left jumps, then a single jump.\n\nWait, wait: \"jump after jump opposite left thrice\". Wait, is the structure \"jump after (jump opposite left thrice)\"? Because \"jump opposite left thrice\" is parsed as the B part. So yes, A is \"jump\", B is \"jump opposite left thrice\". Therefore, the full command is B then A. So first perform the \"jump opposite left thrice\" (which is three times two left turns and a jump), then do the single jump.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFirst part (B): [turn left, turn left, jump] repeated three times.\n\nEach repetition is I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP.\n\nSo three times:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nThen the second part (A): I_JUMP\n\nSo the entire output is:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_JUMP\n\nWait, but wait. The \"jump opposite left thrice\" is three times the action of opposite left jump. So each time, two left turns and a jump. So the sequence of actions is:\n\nTurn left, turn left, jump (first time)\nTurn left, turn left, jump (second)\nTurn left, turn left, jump (third)\nThen a single jump.\n\nBut wait, the actions are all the primitives. So the first three steps are I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_JUMP. Then again, same for the second and third time. Then finally the last jump.\n\nSo the entire sequence would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (first)\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (second)\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (third)\nI_JUMP (the final jump)\n\nCombined, that's:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_JUMP\n\nYes. That should be the correct sequence.\n\nWait, but let's check again.\n\nOriginal command: \"jump after jump opposite left thrice\"\n\nBreaking down:\n\n\"jump after X\" where X is \"jump opposite left thrice\"\n\nSo according to rule 6: A after B → B then A. So A is \"jump\", B is \"jump opposite left thrice\". So execute B then A.\n\nB is \"jump opposite left thrice\" → the verb \"jump\" modified by \"opposite left\" and \"thrice\". \n\n\"opposite left\" on \"jump\" → two left turns then jump. So each instance is two lefts and a jump. \"thrice\" → repeat that three times. So three times: turn left, turn left, jump.\n\nSo B is three times (I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP), then A is I_JUMP.\n\nSo the entire sequence is the B sequence followed by A:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_JUMP\n\nYes.

The input is \"look thrice after jump around right\". Hmm, first, I need to parse each part according to the rules.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. The primitive verbs listed are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. But here we have \"look\". Oh, wait! The rules don't mention \"look\" as a primitive verb. That's confusing. Wait, the user said they are a semantic parsing agent for navigation commands, so maybe \"look\" is a valid action here? Or maybe it's a mistake? Let me check the example again. The example input was \"jump around right\" which mapped to turning right and jumping four times. So in the example, \"jump\" is a verb. But \"look\" isn't listed in the primitive verbs. Hmm, but the input here includes \"look\", so I must have missed something. Wait, the rules say \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\" and lists some verbs. But perhaps \"look\" is also a primitive verb here? Or maybe the problem expects that any verb is allowed, as long as it's converted to uppercase with the prefix I_? Wait, the example uses \"jump\" which is in the list, but \"look\" isn't in the list. Wait, the user might have made a typo, but according to the problem statement, the agent is supposed to handle such commands. Let me recheck the rules again.\n\nRule 1: Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. The examples given are walk→I_WALK, run→I_RUN, etc. So \"jump\" is a primitive verb. But \"look\" isn't listed. However, the problem states that the agent is processing navigation commands, which might include \"look\". Maybe the list in Rule 1 is not exhaustive? Or maybe any verb not in the list is treated as a new action? Wait, the example input uses \"jump\" which is in the list, so perhaps \"look\" here is also a primitive verb and should be converted to I_LOOK. Because the agent is supposed to handle all navigation commands. So I'll proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a valid verb here, so it should be I_LOOK.\n\nNext part: \"look thrice after jump around right\". Let's break this into parts. The structure is \"A after B\", which according to Rule 6 means do B then A. Here, A is \"look thrice\" and B is \"jump around right\". So first process B, then process A thrice.\n\nFirst, process B: \"jump around right\". According to Rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" means 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Wait, the verb here is \"jump\". So \"jump around right\" would be 4 times: turn right, then jump. So each repetition is I_TURN_RIGHT followed by I_JUMP. And this is done four times. So B would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nWait, but in the example given in the problem, the output for \"jump around right\" was \"I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\". Wait, the example output has three jumps and four turns? Let me check. The example input is \"jump around right\", which according to Rule 3 should be 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is turn right, then jump. So each repetition adds two actions: turn and jump. Four times would be four turns and four jumps? Or wait, wait. Wait, the example in the problem says:\n\nIN: jump around right\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, the output has four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP. Hmm, that's conflicting with my previous understanding. Let me check the example again. The output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (1st)\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (2nd)\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (3rd)\nI_TURN_RIGHT (4th repetition? No, that's the fourth turn but no jump.)\n\nWait, the example's output has four turns and three jumps? That's odd. Wait, the example output has:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated three times, then a final I_TURN_RIGHT. So total of four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP.\n\nBut according to the problem's Rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is turn then verb. So four repetitions would be eight actions (each rep has two steps: turn and verb). But the example output is seven elements. So perhaps there's a mistake in the example, or perhaps the Rule is different. Wait the example input is \"jump around right\" which would be \"around right\" applied to \"jump\". So according to Rule 3: 4 repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So each repetition is \"turn right, jump\". So four times would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times, which would be eight actions. But the example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nThat's four turns and three jumps. Which doesn't fit. Hmm, this suggests that maybe the Rule is different. Let me re-examine the problem's description.\n\nProblem says:\n\nRule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb].\n\nWait, but the example shows that \"jump around right\" becomes 4 turns and 3 jumps. So maybe after the four repetitions, you end with a turn. But according to the rule, each repetition is turn and verb, so four times would have four turns and four verbs. So the example seems to contradict. But in the example, the output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (1)\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (2)\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (3)\nI_TURN_RIGHT (4th repetition?)\n\nHmm, perhaps the rule is that \"around\" requires 4 turns but each turn is followed by the verb. Wait, perhaps the rule is that after each turn, you perform the verb, but you have to make a full 360-degree turn. Since turning four times in a direction makes a full circle. So \"jump around right\" would be: turn right, jump; turn right, jump; turn right, jump; turn right, jump; but then after four turns, you end up back in the original direction. So four turns and four jumps. But the example output is four turns and three jumps. Wait, the example's output:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated three times, then another I_TURN_RIGHT, which totals four turns and three jumps. So perhaps the actual rule is that \"around\" is four turns in sequence, but you do the verb only three times. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem's example is wrong. But since the example is given, we must follow its pattern.\n\nLooking at the example:\n\nInput: jump around right → output has four turns and three jumps. The output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWhich is three jumps and four turns, each jump followed by a turn. Except the last turn isn't followed by a jump. So perhaps the structure is: do the verb after each turn, and to make around, you turn four times, doing the verb three times. Wait, that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe \"around\" is implemented as: turn DIR, then verb, and repeat this three times, then turn DIR a fourth time. But that would be three verbs and four turns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that \"around <DIR>\" means you turn DIR four times (totaling 360 degrees), and perform the verb in between each turn. But that would be four turns and four verbs. Hmm. I'm confused here. Since the example shows that \"jump around right\" becomes four turns and three jumps, perhaps the actual way to parse around is that you do the verb three times. Maybe the rule in the problem's example is that \"around\" requires four turns in that direction, and the verb is done three times. But that's conflicting with the written Rule 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the written Rule 3 is wrong, or perhaps the example is a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that \"around\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR then verb], except the last turn is omitted. But that's not stated. But given the example, we need to follow that.\n\nIn the example, the output for \"jump around right\" is four turns and three jumps. How many times is the verb done? Three. So the actual processing is:\n\nTurn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right. So three jumps and four turns.\n\nWhich implies that \"around <DIR>\" is parsed as [turn DIR + verb] repeated three times, then one more turn DIR. So four turns total. But that contradicts the written rule. But according to the example, that's the case.\n\nSo perhaps the actual Rule 3 should be interpreted as 3 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb], followed by a final turn DIR, leading to a total of four turns and three verbs. But why? Maybe because \"around\" implies moving in a circle, and the verb is done once per 90 degrees. So four turns of 90 each, and the verb is done three times? Not sure. But the example's output must be followed.\n\nTherefore, to process \"jump around right\", the output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated three times, then another I_TURN_RIGHT. So total four turns and three jumps.\n\nSo for \"", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 60, "model_reflection": "The initial answer assumes that 'look' maps to a valid action, but according to the rules provided, only primitive verbs (walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right) are mapped to uppercase actions.

But \"run left\" – does that mean turning left and then running? Or is \"run left\" a direction? Hmm, maybe I should check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules, the first rule says primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So \"run\" becomes I_RUN. But the direction \"left\" is part of the command. Wait, the example \"jump around right\" becomes turning right and jumping four times. So \"around right\" is a direction.

So \"run\" is a verb, and \"left\" is a direction. Wait, the primitive verbs include \"run\" (I_RUN), \"turn left\" (I_TURN_LEFT), etc. So \"run left\" might not be a primitive verb. Wait, but \"run left\" could mean \"run to the left\", which might be equivalent to turning left and then moving forward? But according to the rules, there's no mention of moving directions. The primitive actions are only the verbs listed, so \"run\" is I_RUN, and \"turn left\" is I_TURN_LEFT. So perhaps \"run left\" is a misinterpretation here.\n\nWait, maybe the input is \"run left\" meaning \"turn left then run\"? Or is \"run\" a separate action regardless of direction? Let me check the rules again.\n\nRule 1 lists primitive verbs as walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"run\" maps to I_RUN. \"turn left\" maps to I_TURN_LEFT. So if the command is \"run left\", that might not be a primitive verb. Wait, perhaps the input is a combination of turn and verb. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the input?

Alternatively, maybe \"run left\" should be interpreted as \"run\" followed by \"left\", but \"left\" isn't a primitive action. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe \"run left\" is supposed to be \"turn left and then run\", but that's not specified in the rules. Wait, the example in the problem statement is \"jump around right\" which is parsed as turning right each time. So the \"around right\" uses the direction \"right\", but the verb is jump.

So maybe the user intended \"run\" and \"turn left\", but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the intended input is \"turn left and run\", but that's not the case. Wait, let's read the input again: \"run left and walk opposite left thrice\". Maybe \"run left\" is a typo for \"turn left and run\"? But the user input is as given. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is equivalent to \"run\" and \"turn left\", but that's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps \"run left\" is a mistake and the correct command should be \"run and turn left\", but given the input, we need to parse it. Maybe \"run left\" is a command to move in the left direction, but according to the rules, the movement commands are only walk, run, jump, which don't have directions. Directions are only for turning. Therefore, \"run left\" must be parsed as two separate commands. Wait, but \"left\" alone isn't a primitive verb. So perhaps \"run\" and \"left\" is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a way to say \"turn left\" followed by \"run\", but the rules don't specify that.\n\nThis is a problem. Let's check the example again. In the example, \"jump around right\" is parsed as 4 turns right and jumps, ending with a turn right. So \"around right\" is a directive to turn right four times and jump each time. So \"around\" is a keyword followed by direction. Similarly, \"opposite left\" would be two turns left. \n\nWait, the input in question is \"run left and walk opposite left thrice\". Let's parse this as two parts: part A is \"run left\", part B is \"walk opposite left thrice\". But \"run left\" – perhaps the \"left\" here is a direction, but according to the rules, the only actions that have directions are turn, around, opposite. So the primitive verbs are run, walk, jump, which don't have directions. Then \"run left\" is not a valid primitive verb, but perhaps the user intended \"turn left then run\"? But the rules don't specify that. Therefore, maybe there's a mistake in the input. Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a misstatement, and the intended command is \"turn left and run\".\n\nBut since the input is given as \"run left and walk opposite left thrice\", I need to parse it as written. Let's try to parse each component according to the rules.\n\nThe entire command is \"run left and walk opposite left thrice\". The \"and\" means do A then B. So first do \"run left\", then do \"walk opposite left thrice\". \n\nBut what is \"run left\"? If \"run left\" is a verb followed by a direction, which isn't a primitive verb. Wait, perhaps \"run left\" is a typo for \"turn left run\", which would be \"turn left then run\", but according to the rules, how would that be handled? Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" should be \"run\" followed by \"turn left\", but that's not indicated. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"left\" in \"run left\" is a direction for the verb. But according to the rules, the only direction-based constructs are in the turn, around, opposite. So the verb \"run\" is I_RUN regardless of direction. So perhaps \"run left\" is simply \"I_RUN\" followed by \"I_TURN_LEFT\". But why would the left be there? That seems odd. But according to the rules, if \"run left\" is not a primitive verb, then each word must be parsed as separate. So \"run\" is a verb, and \"left\" is a primitive verb. Wait, \"turn left\" is a primitive verb. But \"left\" alone is not. So \"run\" and \"left\" must be two separate tokens. Wait, but \"run left\" would be parsed as \"run\" (I_RUN) and \"left\" – but \"left\" is not a primitive verb unless it's preceded by \"turn\". So this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original input should be \"run and turn left\", which would be parsed as I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT. So \"run left\" could be a shorthand for that. So assuming that \"run left\" is equivalent to \"turn left then run\", but according to the rules, that's not specified. Alternatively, the user might have intended \"run left\" as \"run in the left direction\", which would imply turning left first and then running. But again, the rules don't state that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a mistake, and the intended command is \"turn left run\", which would be parsed using rule 6: \"run after turn left\" which would be turn left then run. But again, this is speculative.\n\nGiven that this is a test, perhaps the key is to parse according to the rules as best as possible. So let's proceed.\n\nThe first part: \"run left\" – perhaps this is a mistake, but if we take \"run\" as a verb, which becomes I_RUN", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 90, "model_reflection": "The interpretation of 'run left' as 'I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT' is based on the assumption that 'left' refers to a turn after the run.

The only slight ambiguity is whether 'run left' could mean something else (e.g., running in a left direction), but without a defined primitive verb for that, the breakdown into 'run' followed by 'turn left' is the most logical interpretation.", "new_response": "None"}

The user's input is \"look right thrice after jump opposite right twice\". Hmm, first, I need to parse each part according to the given rules.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. They map to uppercase actions. But the command here starts with \"look right\". Wait, \"look\" isn't one of the primitive verbs listed. That might be a problem. Wait, the user might have made a mistake, or maybe \"look\" here is intended to be a turn action. Let me check the rules again. Rule 1 says the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look right\" isn't in the primitives. But perhaps \"look right\" should be interpreted as \"turn right\"? Or maybe it's a typo and they meant \"turn right\"? Or maybe \"look right\" is a different action, but according to the rules, only the listed primitives are allowed. Hmm. Wait, the example uses \"jump around right\" which maps to turning right and jumping four times. So in the example, \"around right\" is handled as four repetitions of turn right + jump. But the problem here is \"look right thrice after jump opposite right twice\". \n\nWait, perhaps \"look right\" is not a primitive, so maybe we need to treat it as a non-primitive action. But according to the rules, the user should use the primitive verbs. If \"look right\" isn't a primitive, then maybe this is a parsing error. However, maybe the user intended \"look right\" to be equivalent to \"turn right\", since there's no other way to represent looking. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a new action, but according to the rules, we can't have that. The problem might be expecting us to treat \"look right\" as a different action, but the rules don't specify that. Wait, the problem says I'm a semantic parsing agent for navigation commands with the given rules. So I must use those rules. So if \"look\" is not a primitive verb, then how to handle it? Maybe it's a mistake. Let me check the original example. The example input was \"jump around right\" which translates to the actions. So the input words are the primitives. Therefore, the user's input here has \"look right\", which is not a primitive. But maybe \"look right\" should be interpreted as \"turn right\"? Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is a typo, but the user might have intended it. Wait, perhaps the user intended \"look right\" to be \"turn right\", because there's no other action. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a different action, but according to the rules, only the listed ones are allowed. So this might be a problem. But since the rules don't include \"look\", maybe we need to ignore that or find a way to parse it. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe \"look right\" is a mistake and should be considered as \"turn right\", so proceed under that assumption? Or perhaps the problem is designed to test handling of non-primitive verbs, but according to the rules, we can only process the primitives. Wait, the user might have made a mistake, but I have to process the command as per the rules. Therefore, \"look right\" is not a valid primitive. But since the user provided this input, perhaps there's a way to parse it. Wait, maybe \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\". Because looking right would require turning that way. Maybe that's the assumption we need to make here. Otherwise, the input can't be processed. So, assuming that \"look right\" means \"turn right\", then proceed. Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is a different action, but the rules don't include it, which would be a problem. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe \"look right\" is a typo for \"turn right\". Let me proceed under the assumption that \"look right\" should be treated as \"turn right\". Because otherwise, we can't map it to any action. So moving forward with that assumption. So the input becomes: turn right thrice after jump opposite right twice.\n\nNow, breaking down the input: \"look right thrice after jump opposite right twice\". So the main structure is \"A after B\", where A is \"look right thrice\" and B is \"jump opposite right twice\". According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So first do the jump opposite right twice, then do look right thrice.\n\nFirst, parse \"jump opposite right twice\". The structure here is \"opposite right\" followed by \"twice\". Wait, \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, \"opposite right\" would be two turns right then jump. But \"jump opposite right twice\" would be repeating that twice. Wait, \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. Let's parse this step by step.\n\n\"jump opposite right\": according to rule 2, \"opposite right\" means two turns right, then the verb. So the verb here is jump. So \"jump opposite right\" would be I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT, then I_JUMP.\n\nNow, \"jump opposite right twice\" means repeat this entire sequence twice. So each time, it's two turns right and a jump. And since it's twice, the entire sequence [turn right, turn right, jump] is done twice. Wait, wait: rule 4 says that \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if the verb is modified by \"opposite right\", then each instance of the verb in the repetition would be the modified verb. So \"jump opposite right twice\" would be (I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP) repeated twice.\n\nSo that part would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP.\n\nNow, moving on to \"look right thrice\". If \"look right\" is equivalent to I_TURN_RIGHT, then \"thrice\" would mean repeat that three times. So \"look right thrice\" would be I_TURN_RIGHT repeated three times. Wait, but according to rule 4, \"A twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if \"look right\" is a verb, then \"look right thrice\" would be the action for look right repeated three times. But according to our initial assumption, look right is I_TURN_RIGHT. So each occurrence of look right would be a single turn right. Therefore, \"look right thrice\" would be three I_TURN_RIGHT actions. However, wait: \"look right\" would be a single action. Wait, no. Wait, the primitive verbs are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\", each of which maps to a single action. If \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\", then each \"look right\" is a single I_TURN_RIGHT. Then \"thrice\" would be three times that. So three I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nPutting it all together: the entire command is \"A after B\", so B then A. So first do the jump opposite right twice, then the look right thrice.\n\nSo the entire sequence would be:\n\nB: jump opposite right twice → [turn right, turn right, jump, turn right, turn right, jump]\n\nA: look right thrice → [turn right, turn right, turn right]\n\nCombined: B followed by A → each action separated by spaces.\n\nSo the full action sequence would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nWait, but wait again. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the \"jump opposite right\" is a verb modified by opposite right. So each time in the twice repetition, it's two turns right and then jump. So each jump opposite right is two turns right and jump. So doing that twice would be:\n\nturn right, turn right, jump, turn right, turn right, jump. Then the look right thrice would be three turns right.\n\nBut each action is separated by spaces. So the output would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nBut wait, the problem is the initial parsing of \"look right\". If \"look right\" isn't a primitive verb, then according to the rules, the agent should not be able to parse it. However, the user provided this input, so perhaps there's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\", as per the available primitives. If that's the case, then the processing continues. Otherwise, this input can't be parsed. But given the problem, we have to assume that \"look right\" is intended to be a turn right. So proceed.\n\nTherefore, the final sequence would be the actions of jump opposite right done twice, followed by look right thrice, which is three turns right. So the output should be all the actions in order.\n", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 65, "model_reflection": "The original response misinterprets the phrasing 'jump opposite right twice' and how 'thrice after' should be applied.

Wait, but how does combining a verb with a direction work? Let me check the rules again. Rule 1 lists primitive verbs mapping to actions. But \"jump right\" might be a bit tricky. Wait, looking at the example, like \"jump around right\" was broken down into turning right then jumping, etc. Hmm, but in this case, \"jump right\" isn't using any of the special constructs like \"around\" or \"opposite\". \n\nWait, maybe \"jump right\" is actually two separate commands: jump and then turn right? No, but the original command is \"jump right and run\". The \"and\" splits it into two parts. Wait, perhaps \"jump right\" is a single action where direction is part of the jump. But according to the given rules, the primitive verbs map directly to uppercase actions. The problem is, \"jump right\" isn't listed in the rules. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the rules mention that \"opposite <DIR>\" and \"around <DIR>\" are specific constructs. But \"jump right\" here might just be the user instructing to jump in the right direction. However, according to the primitive verbs, \"jump\" is just I_JUMP. There's no mention of direction affecting the action. So perhaps \"jump right\" is just I_JUMP followed by a turn right? Or maybe the \"right\" here is a mistake, or maybe it's a direction to turn before jumping?\n\nWait, the example input was \"jump around right\" which resulted in four turns right and jumps each time. So \"around right\" is a modifier on the jump. But in this case, \"jump right\" is different. Let me parse the command again.\n\nThe input is \"jump right and run\". The \"and\" splits into two parts: \"jump right\" and \"run\". So the first part is \"jump right\", which might be \"jump\" plus a direction. But according to the rules, the primitive verbs are mapped directly. So perhaps \"jump right\" is not a standard command. Wait, maybe the user intended to turn right and then jump? Or is it a different action? Or perhaps \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\" and then \"jump\"? But that's not specified in the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the direction after a verb is indicating direction. But according to the rules, there's no such construct. The rules only have \"opposite <DIR>\" and \"around <DIR>\", and \"twice\", etc. So \"jump right\" might be a malformed command, but assuming that the user wants to jump in the right direction, but according to the given rules, there's no way to represent direction with a verb unless it's through the \"around <DIR>\" or \"opposite <DIR>\" constructs. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe \"jump right\" is a mistake, and the correct parsing is to treat \"jump\" as a verb, and then \"right\" as a turn. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to use \"turn right\" then \"jump\". Let's see. Let's break down \"jump right and run\" as \"jump\" and \"right and run\", but that doesn't make sense. Wait, the \"and\" has to split the two parts. So \"jump right\" is A, then \"run\" is B. So how to parse \"jump right\"?\n\nWait, perhaps the \"right\" here is a direction for the jump. But according to the rules, there's no way to represent direction with a verb except through the \"around\" or \"opposite\" constructs. Therefore, maybe the \"right\" here is a typo, or perhaps the user intended \"jump\" followed by a \"turn right\". But the rules don't specify that. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is a command to turn right and then jump. But that's not a rule listed.\n\nWait, maybe the input is ambiguous. Let me check the example again. In the example, \"jump around right\" is parsed as 4 repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So \"around right\" is a modifier to the jump. But \"jump right\" without \"around\" would not be a standard construct. So perhaps the user made a mistake here, but we need to parse it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\" and then \"jump\". So first turn right, then jump. If that's the case, then \"jump right\" would be I_TURN_RIGHT followed by I_JUMP. Then \"run\" would be I_RUN. So the entire command would be \"jump right\" (I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP) then \"run\" (I_RUN). But how to determine if that's the right approach.\n\nBut according to the rules, there's no direct instruction on how to handle a verb followed by a direction. The rules specify handling \"opposite <DIR>\", \"around <DIR>\", \"twice\", \"and\", etc. So if the command is \"jump right\", which isn't a standard construct, perhaps the parser should ignore the direction, but that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is a mistake. But given the input, the assistant needs to parse according to the rules. So maybe the user intended \"jump\" and then \"right\", but \"right\" as a command. But \"right\" alone isn't a command unless part of a verb. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake and intended to say \"turn right and jump\", but the command here is \"jump right and run\". Alternatively, maybe \"jump right\" is a typo for \"turn right\". But given the input, we need to work with it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is a compound verb. But according to the rules, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump\" is a verb, and \"right\" is a direction. But how to combine them. Wait, \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitive verbs. So perhaps \"jump right\" is not a valid primitive verb, so the correct way is to treat \"jump\" and then \"right\" as separate. But \"right\" alone isn't a verb.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me think again. The rules state that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So the primitive verbs are: walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump\" is a verb, which maps to I_JUMP. \"Turn right\" is a verb, which maps to I_TURN_RIGHT. So in the input command \"jump right and run\", how to parse this?\n\nWait, the input is \"jump right and run\". The \"and\" separates the two parts. So the first part is \"jump right\", then the second is \"run\". But \"jump right\" would be a verb plus something. If \"right\" is a direction, but not a verb. But according to the rules, the only way to have direction is in constructs like \"around <DIR>\" or \"opposite <DIR>\", or as part of the turn verbs.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"right\" here is a mistake, and the intended command is \"jump and run\", which would be I_JUMP I_RUN. But the input is \"jump right and run\". Alternatively, maybe the user meant \"jump and turn right and run\", but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"jump right\" is a misphrasing for \"turn right then jump\". For example, in some contexts, jumping right could mean moving right, but according to the given rules, there's no such mapping. Therefore, the only way \"right\" can be used is in \"turn right\" as a verb, or as a direction in \"around right\" or \"opposite right\".\n\nGiven that, the \"right\" in \"jump right\" doesn't fit a verb, so perhaps it's part of a construct. But since \"jump\" is a verb, and \"right\" is a direction, but the verb is not \"jump right\", but \"jump\" alone. Then perhaps the \"right\" is a mistake, and the action should be I_JUMP followed by I_TURN_RIGHT, but that's not according to the rules. The rules don't specify that a verb can take a direction. The only way direction is used is via the \"around\" and \"opposite\" constructs.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"jump right\" is a misstatement, and the user should have said \"turn right then jump\", but according to the rules, how would we parse it?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"and\" is being misused. Let's look at the original command again. The user wrote \"jump right and run\". According to rule 5: \"A and B\" = A then B. So A is \"jump right\", B is \"run\". So we need to parse \"jump right\" first.\n\nIf \"jump right\" can't be parsed according to the rules, perhaps the parser should ignore the right. But that's not acceptable.\n\nWait another approach: Let's see the possible parses. The primitive verbs include \"turn right\" as a verb. So \"turn right\" maps to I_TURN_RIGHT. But \"jump\" is a verb. So \"jump right\" could be \"jump\" followed by \"turn right\"? But how to justify that. Or maybe \"jump\" is the verb, and \"right\" is a direction modifier, but", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The command 'jump right and run' can be broken down using the given rules.

So the structure is, for a command like \"walk around right\", you do: turn right + walk, four times. So in that example, the output was four turns right followed by jumps, but wait, the example given in the problem was \"jump around right\" leading to four turns right and four jumps. Wait, in the example, \"jump around right\" becomes four pairs of turn right then jump, so each repetition is turn right then jump, four times total.\n\nSo applying that to \"turn around right\". Wait, the verb here is \"turn\", so \"turn around right\" would be interpreted as \"around right\" modifying the verb \"turn\". Wait, no. Wait, the original command is \"turn around right and walk around right\".\n\nWait, \"turn around right\" – perhaps this is ambiguous. Wait, according to the rules, \"around <DIR>\" is a modifier that applies to a verb. So the structure is [verb] [around DIR], so \"turn around right\" would be parsed as the verb \"turn\" modified by \"around right\", but wait, in the rules, \"around <DIR>\" is a modifier that replaces the verb with the 4 repetitions. Hmm. Let me re-examine the rules.\n\nRule 3: \"<verb> around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Wait, no. Wait the rule states: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Wait, the way the rule is written is that the entire phrase \"around <DIR>\" maps to the 4 repetitions. Wait, no. Wait, the rule says:\n\n\"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb].\n\nWait, looking back: \"3. 'around <DIR>' = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb].\" So the \"around <DIR>\" part is the phrase, so when you have a verb followed by around and a direction, you replace it with four times [turn DIR then do the verb]. For example, \"walk around right\" becomes four times [turn right walk]. So the example given in the problem for \"jump around right\" gives four times [turn right jump], hence the output is four times I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP, then another turn right. Wait, no, the example output is:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, wait, the output has four turns and four jumps? Wait, in the example, the output starts with I_TURN_RIGHT, then I_JUMP, then repeats that, but each repetition adds a turn and a jump. Wait, wait, let's count:\n\nThe output in the example is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, that's four times \"turn right jump\" but wait, each \"turn right\" followed by a jump, but after four jumps, there's a fifth turn right? Hmm. Wait, the example output seems to have four jumps and five turns right. Wait, perhaps the example is four times [turn right then jump], which would be four pairs of turn and jump, but in the output, the example has:\n\nEach of the four jumps would be preceded by a turn, but then after the fourth jump, you turn again. Wait, but according to the example output, the number of turns and jumps:\n\nThe example output has:\n\nTurn, jump, turn, jump, turn, jump, turn, jump, turn.\n\nSo total of 4 jumps and 5 turns. Hmm. Wait, but the rule says 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb], which would be four times each turn and verb. So four times [turn right, jump], which would be four turns and four jumps. But the example output shows four jumps and five turns. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Let me check again the example:\n\nInput: jump around right\n\nOutput: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nEach \"turn right\" is followed by a jump, except the last one. So:\n\n1. I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (first rep)\n2. I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (second)\n3. I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (third)\n4. I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (fourth)\nThen, the fifth I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nWait, why is the last turn there? That suggests that the rule might be that after each verb, you turn again. Wait, maybe the rule is that \"around\" means \"turn, then do the verb, then turn again, repeat this four times\". Or perhaps the example is incorrect. Wait, perhaps the example is correct and the rule's description might be slightly different. Let's look again.\n\nIn the example, \"jump around right\" becomes four jumps and five turns. So each of the four jumps is preceded by a turn, and after each jump, another turn. But how does that make sense? Wait, perhaps the rule is that \"around <DIR>\" is equivalent to doing [turn DIR, verb, turn DIR] four times. But that doesn't fit either. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that \"around <DIR>\" means turn DIR, then do the verb, then repeat four times. Wait, but according to the problem statement, rule 3 says \"4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]\".\n\nWait, if each repetition is \"turn DIR then verb\", then four repetitions would be:\n\nturn DIR, verb, turn DIR, verb, turn DIR, verb, turn DIR, verb.\n\nThat would be four turns and four verbs, right? So each repetition is a pair. So in the example, four pairs of turn right and jump.\n\nBut the output in the example is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nWhich has four I_JUMP and five I_TURN_RIGHT. So that's four verbs and five turns, which contradicts the expectation. Therefore, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the rule. Wait, maybe the example is correct, but the rule explanation is different. Maybe \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR, verb], then an additional turn DIR. Or maybe the example is missing a turn. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that \"around <DIR>\" is equivalent to \"turn DIR then verb\" four times, then a final turn DIR. But why?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem example's output is a typo. Or perhaps the actual rule is that \"around\" requires a full rotation, so four turns to make a circle, but the verb is executed four times. Alternatively, perhaps the example output should have four turns and four jumps. But in the example, the output has five turns. That's a problem. How to resolve this?\n\nWait, the problem statement's example input \"jump around right\" produces an output that is four jumps and four turns? Or perhaps each turn is cumulative, and the final turn is part of the four. Wait, the output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nEach turn right followed by a jump, then another turn. So the sequence is:\n\nTurn, jump, turn, jump, turn, jump, turn, jump, turn.\n\nWait, that's five turns and four jumps. Hmm. So according to the example, \"jump around right\" becomes five turns and four jumps. But according to the rule, it should be four repetitions of [turn + verb], which would be four turns and four jumps. So perhaps the rule in the problem is not exactly as written. Alternatively, maybe the example is a mistake, but assuming that the problem's example is correct, we need to model the processing after that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of the verb, each preceded by a turn DIR, but then you turn again after each verb. Or maybe the total number of turns is four times, and the verbs four times. Wait, but the example shows five turns. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that \"around <DIR>\" is equivalent to four repetitions of [turn DIR, verb], and then another turn DIR. But why? Or maybe the problem's example is wrong, but the user is expecting us to follow the example. Alternatively, perhaps the rule 3 should be interpreted as follows: when you have a verb followed by \"around <DIR>\", you do [turn DIR, verb] four times, then turn DIR again. Which would explain the example. But that's not what the rule says. Hmm.\n\nThe rule says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the example should have four repetitions of that pair. So four times \"turn right, jump\", which would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nThat", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 50, "model_reflection": "The interpretation of 'turn around right' was incorrect.

Since \"turn\" is implied here, each turn left would be I_TURN_LEFT. So, opposite left would be two I_TURN_LEFTs. Then, \"thrice\" means we need to repeat that sequence three times. So each repetition is two left turns, done three times. That gives us 2*3 = 6 left turns.\n\nNext part is \"turn around right\". Rule 3 says \"around right\" is four repetitions of [turn right + verb]. The verb here is \"turn\", but wait, \"around right\" would involve turning right each time. Wait, the original command is \"turn around right\", so the verb is \"turn\" followed by the direction. Wait, no. Wait, the \"around\" applies to the direction. Let me check rule 3 again. \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Wait, no. Wait the rule says: \"around <DIR>\" means four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Wait, but the verb here is the action that comes before \"around right\"? Hmm, no. Wait, in the command \"turn around right\", the structure is \"turn\" is the main verb, and \"around right\" is the modifier. Wait, but according to the rules, how does this parse?\n\nWait, let's think. The command is \"turn around right\". So \"around right\" is modifying the verb \"turn\". According to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" translates to 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Wait, but here the verb is \"turn\". So applying rule 3, \"turn around right\" would be 4 repetitions of [turn right + I_TURN]. Wait, but the original verb is \"turn\", so the structure here is that \"around right\" means to perform four times the sequence of turning right and then doing the verb. The verb here is \"turn\", but that seems a bit circular. Wait, maybe the \"turn\" in \"turn around right\" is the main verb, which maps to I_TURN. So \"turn around right\" would be 4 repetitions of [turn right], since the verb here is \"turn\". Wait, but rule 3 says [turn DIR + verb], so each repetition is first turning in DIR direction, then performing the verb. Wait, but the original verb here is \"turn\", but how does that work? Wait, perhaps the original verb is \"turn\" (I_TURN), so \"turn around right\" would be four times [turn right and then turn]. Wait, that seems odd. Let me re-examine the example given in the problem statement.\n\nIn the example: input \"jump around right\" becomes \"I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\". Wait, wait, the example output shows four turns and four jumps. Wait, the example output has four turns right followed by jumps. Wait, wait, the example input is \"jump around right\", which should be four repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So each cycle is turn right then jump, done four times. So the output would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times, which would be 4 turns and 4 jumps. But in the example output, it's written as four I_TURN_RIGHT and four I_JUMP, each alternating. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nInput: jump around right\nOutput: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, the output is four turns and four jumps? Wait, the output has four I_TURN_RIGHT and four I_JUMP, each pair of turn then jump, four times. But the last action is a turn without a jump. Wait, that example's output seems to have four turns and three jumps? Wait, let me count:\n\nBreaking down the example:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (1st)\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (2nd)\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (3rd)\nI_TURN_RIGHT (4th)\n\nWait, no. The output is: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT. So that's three I_TURN_RIGHT followed by I_JUMP each, then a final I_TURN_RIGHT. Wait, that's four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP. Hmm, that seems inconsistent with the rule. Wait, according to rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the verb here is \"jump\", so each repetition is [turn DIR + verb], so each pair. So four repetitions would be four turns and four jumps. But the example output shows four turns and three jumps.

I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (first repetition)\n2. I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (second)\n3. I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (third)\n4. I_TURN_RIGHT (fourth?)\n\nBut the fourth repetition would need to be turn right and jump, but the output ends with a turn right. Hmm. Wait, maybe the example is wrong? Or perhaps the rule is being interpreted differently. Wait, the original example input is \"jump around right\", so \"jump\" is the verb, \"around right\" is the modifier. So per rule 3, \"around right\" would mean 4 repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So each cycle is turn right, jump. Do this four times. Then the output should be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times. Which would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP.\n\nBut the example output is missing the last I_JUMP. Wait, but according to the given example, the output is as written. So perhaps the example is a typo, or perhaps the rule is different. Alternatively, maybe \"around\" is four turns, and each turn is followed by the verb except the last one. Hmm, but according to the problem's example, perhaps the rule is that \"around <DIR>\" equals four turns in that direction followed by the verb each time. Wait, but the example output contradicts that. Alternatively, perhaps \"around\" is four turns, and the verb is performed four times, once after each turn. But according to the example, \"jump around right\" becomes 4 I_TURN_RIGHT and 3 I_JUMP. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, the example output has four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP.

Which suggests that the rule might be four turns and the verb three times? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the \"around\" is interpreted as four turns, and the verb is done four times, but the first three times after each turn except the last. But that complicates things. Wait, perhaps the example is a mistake, but according to the problem's given example, when \"jump around right\" is input, the output is the four turns right, each followed by a jump, except the last turn is not followed by a jump. But that would be three jumps. Which would mean that \"around\" requires four turns and three repetitions of the verb. But that seems inconsistent with the rule's description.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR then verb], but the initial turn DIR is done first, then verb, repeated four times. Wait, but that would be four turns and four verbs. Which would be eight actions, but the example output is seven actions. Hmm. This suggests that perhaps the problem's example might have a mistake, but as per the problem's instructions, we have to follow the example. Wait, perhaps the example is correct. Let me re-examine the rule.\n\nRule 3 says: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb].\n\nWait, the verb here refers to the original verb. So in \"jump around right\", the verb is jump. So each repetition is [turn right + jump]. So four repetitions would be:\n\nturn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump. Then, four turns and four jumps, total eight actions. But the example output has four turns and three jumps, which totals seven. So this suggests that maybe the rule is different. Wait, the example output given is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWhich is four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP. So seven actions. How does that align with the rule?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem's example is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rule. Alternatively, maybe \"around\" means to do four turns, each followed by the verb, except the last turn. So three verbs. But that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that \"around <DIR>\" = 4 turns in DIR, each followed by the verb. Except the last turn is not followed by a verb. Which would be the example. But that's not clear. Hmm. This is a bit of a problem.\n\nBut since the example is given, perhaps we need to follow it. So for \"jump around right\", the output is four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP, as per the example.

Let's parse \"turn around right\" first. Wait, \"turn around right\" might be parsed as \"around right\" applied to the verb \"turn\". Wait, no. Wait, \"turn around right\" – perhaps the user meant \"turn around right\", but according to the rules, \"around <DIR>\" applies to a verb.

But according to the rules, we have to follow the given structures.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"turn around right\" is \"turn right\" twice (since opposite would be two turns). Wait, no, the rule for \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the command. But regardless, according to the rules given:\n\nRule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"around right\" applies to a verb. So in the command \"turn around right\", the verb is \"turn\", so \"around right\" would modify \"turn\", leading to 4 repetitions of [turn right + turn]. But that seems odd. Let's take an example. Like, \"walk around right\" would be [turn right walk] x4. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nBut then \"turn around right\" would be [turn right turn] x4. Hmm, but \"turn\" here would be a verb. However, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Wait, \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, the primitive verbs are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" mapped to I_TURN_LEFT and I_TURN_RIGHT. Wait, so the verb \"turn\" in the command must be a mistake? Or perhaps \"turn\" isn't a valid primitive. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nRule 1: Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. The list includes turn left and turn right. So \"turn\" by itself isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, how to parse \"turn around right\"? Because \"turn\" is not a primitive. Wait, perhaps the command here is \"turn around right\", but \"turn\" is a verb that must be parsed. Wait, but according to the rules, the only turn-related primitives are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". So \"turn\" alone isn't a valid primitive. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake here. Wait, but the input is given, so we need to parse it.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo, but according to the problem statement, we have to work with the given input. Let's assume that \"turn around right\" is a valid command. How?\n\nWait, \"turn around right\" – perhaps \"around right\" applies to the verb \"turn\", but since \"turn\" isn't a primitive, maybe \"turn\" here refers to turning in the direction opposite? No. Alternatively, maybe the verb here is \"turn right\", which is a primitive. Wait, but \"turn around right\" would then be parsed as \"around right\" applied to the verb \"turn right\"? Hmm, but that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the command is \"turn around right\" meaning to turn right four times, but that would be a full circle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended \"turn around\" as a 180-degree turn (two left or right turns), but according to the rules, \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR. So \"opposite left\" would be two left turns (which would be a U-turn). But the command here is \"turn around right\", which might be a way to say turn right around, which could be ambiguous. However, according to the problem's rules, we must follow the given structures.\n\nSo, back to the original problem. The input command has two parts:\n\nPart B: turn around right thrice\n\nPart A: jump around right thrice\n\nAnd the structure is A after B → B then A.\n\nSo, process each part.\n\nStarting with B: \"turn around right thrice\"\n\nBreaking this down: \"around right\" applies to the verb. But the verb here is \"turn\"? But \"turn\" is not a primitive verb. Wait, this seems like a problem. Because according to the rules, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn\" alone is not a primitive verb. Therefore, perhaps the command \"turn around right\" is actually \"turn_right around right\"? Or maybe the user made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"turn\" here refers to \"turn right\" or \"turn left\", but the command is ambiguous. Wait, but the input is given, so we need to parse it. Maybe \"turn around right\" is parsed as \"around right\" applied to the verb \"turn\", which is not a primitive. That would be invalid. Therefore, perhaps this is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe \"turn around right\" is equivalent to \"turn right around right\", but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the command is \"turn around right\" as a way to say \"turn left\", but no. This is a problem. Wait, perhaps the user intended \"turn around\" as a verb meaning to do a 180, which would be two turns in a direction. But according to the rules, \"opposite <DIR>\" is that. However, in this case, the command is \"around right\", so perhaps the presence of \"around right\" in the command must be parsed as per rule 3.\n\nBut if the verb is \"turn\", which is not a primitive, then we can't process it. So perhaps the original command is a mistake, but we need to proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is \"turn around right\", where the verb is \"turn right\", but that's a stretch. Let's re-express the command. Maybe \"turn around right\" should be parsed as \"turn around\" (as a verb) in the direction right. But the rules don't cover that. Therefore, perhaps the problem is that the command is \"turn around right\", which is \"around right\" applied to the verb \"turn\", which is invalid. But since this is the given input, maybe we have to proceed as if \"turn\" is a valid verb. But according to the rules, it's not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and meant \"turn right around right\", but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the \"turn around right\" is equivalent to \"opposite right\", which would be two right turns. But that's not according to the given rules. The rules say \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR. So \"opposite right\" would be two right turns.\n\nBut the command here is \"turn around right\", not \"opposite right\". So this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is designed to have us parse \"turn around right\" as per the rules. Let's consider that \"around right\" is applied to the verb \"turn\", but the verb \"turn\" isn't a primitive. This seems invalid.

Let's parse \"turn around left twice after look\" as \"turn around left twice after look\", so \"A after B\" is B then A. So first do \"look\", then \"turn around left twice\". But \"look\" isn't an action. So perhaps the user intended \"look\" to be a no-op, or perhaps it's an error. But according to the rules, we can only use the primitives given. So if \"look\" isn't a primitive, maybe it's invalid. But the problem gives this as input, so we have to process it.\n\nWait, perhaps \"look\" is a mistake in the input. But assuming that the input is correct, maybe we need to proceed. Let's suppose that \"look\" is supposed to be a verb. But according to the rules, the primitive verbs are the ones listed.

Let's proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is not a valid action, but according to the command structure, the \"after\" rule requires that \"B\" is done before \"A\". However, if B is not a valid action, then how do we handle it? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" here is a typo for \"walk\".

Therefore, perhaps \"look\" here is supposed to be a typo for one of the allowed verbs, but we have to work with what's given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\", but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore \"look\" because it's not a valid action, but that's not specified in the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is structured such that \"look\" is not an action, but the command is \"turn around left twice after [some action]\". But according to the input, the user wrote \"look\" there. So perhaps this is a trick question.

But given the input, we have to work with it.\n\nAssuming that \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\", then \"turn around left twice\" would be A, and B is \"walk\", so the sequence would be walk followed by the actions for \"turn around left twice\". Let's proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\" (I_WALK), given that the example uses \"jump around right\" which is a valid command.\n\nBut that's a big assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and \"look\" is part of the command, but how to parse it? The problem says to output the sequence of actions according to the rules. So if \"look\" is not a primitive verb, then there's no action for it. Therefore, perhaps the command is invalid. But the user provided it, so there must be a way.\n\nWait, perhaps \"look\" is a direction. Like \"left\", \"right\", but \"look\" isn't a direction. Directions are left or right. So no. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting to ignore non-primitive verbs. So \"look\" would be ignored. But that's not stated in the rules. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is supposed to be \"turn left\", but that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is a mistake and should be \"left\", but that's unclear.\n\nThis is a problem.

But the verb here would be \"turn\", but wait. Wait, \"turn around left\" would be \"around left\" applied to \"turn\". Wait, the original command is \"turn around left\", so \"turn\" is the verb, and \"around left\" is the modifier. So according to rule 3: \"around left\" means 4 repetitions of [turn left + verb]. Wait, no. Wait, \"around <DIR>\" applies to a verb. For example, in the example \"jump around right\" is parsed as four jumps with turns. The structure is: [turn right + jump] four times.\n\nSo \"turn around left\" would be the verb \"turn\" with \"around left\" modifier. Wait, but \"turn left\" is a primitive verb. So \"turn around left\" would be parsed as:\n\n\"Around <DIR>\" applies to the verb. But the verb here would be \"turn\", but the direction is already specified. Wait, this is confusing. Wait, \"turn\" is the verb, but \"around left\" is the modifier. So according to rule 3, \"around left\" would require repeating [turn left + turn], four times? Wait, but the original verb is \"turn\". Hmm.\n\nWait, the structure for \"around <DIR>\" is that it's a modifier on the verb. So \"turn around left\" would mean that the verb is \"turn\" and the modifier is \"around left\". But according to the rules, \"around <DIR>\" applies to the verb. So each repetition would be [turn left] then [turn], but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, but the primitive verbs are atomic. \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitives. So if the command is \"turn around left\", then \"turn\" is the verb, but \"around left\" modifies it. Wait, maybe the structure is that \"around left\" applies to the verb. So \"turn around left\" would be equivalent to doing [turn left then turn] four times? But that seems odd. Wait, but the verb here is \"turn left\"?

Wait:\n\nExample input: jump around right → output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT ?\n\nWait, no, the example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT (only 7 actions). Wait, wait the example says:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT \n\nWait, how many repetitions? The rule says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So four times [turn right + jump], which would be 4*2=8 actions, but the example output has 7 actions. Wait, discrepancy.\n\nWait the example output has:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (1), I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (2), I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (3), I_TURN_RIGHT (total 7 actions). Wait, so three jumps and four turns. That's 4 turns right and 3 jumps. So the example output seems to have 4 turns and 3 jumps. So the rule may have a mistake. Or perhaps the example is incorrect. Wait, according to the example:\n\njump around right → each around is 4 repetitions, which would be:\n\n[turn right, jump] *4. But the output in the example is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT \n\nWhich is 4 turns and 3 jumps. So the first action is turn right, then jump, then turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right. So 4 turns and 3 jumps. That's three times [turn right jump] and then a final turn right. Hmm, perhaps the rule is that around DIR is 4 repetitions of the verb, each preceded by a turn DIR, but then total of 4 turns and 4 verbs. But the example contradicts that. The example's output has 4 turns and 3 verbs.\n\nThis suggests that the example might be wrong, or the rule's wording is incorrect.\n\nBut regardless, according to the example, \"jump around right\" gives four turns right and three jumps, ending with a turn. So the pattern is [turn, jump] repeated three times, then a turn? Not sure.\n\nBut given that, to parse \"around <DIR>\", we need to follow the example. The example shows that for 4 repetitions, the output has four turns and three jumps. That doesn't align. So maybe the rule is actually: after each turn, do the verb, except the last turn. But the example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (1), I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (2), I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (3), I_TURN_RIGHT (4th turn without jump). So total four turns, three jumps. Which would imply three repetitions, not four. But the rule says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions. This is a contradiction. The example seems to use three repetitions. Hmm.\n\nThis complicates the parsing. But to proceed with the given example:\n\nAssuming that \"around <DIR>\" means 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb], but the example shows three repetitions and a final turn. So maybe the number of repetitions is equal to the number of verbs. Not sure.\n\nGiven the confusion, but proceeding with the original rule as stated:\n\nRule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb].\n\nSo \"jump around right\" would be:\n\n[turn right jump] repeated four times, followed by...? No, according to the example, the output ends with a turn right. So the example's output has four turns and three jumps, which suggests that the actual rule might be different. But perhaps the example is a typo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"around\" construct requires 4 turns and 4 verbs, each turn followed by a verb, totaling four of each. But example output shows three verbs and four turns. Not sure.\n\nIn any case, returning to the original problem:\n\nAssuming \"look\" is equivalent to turn, and proceeding:\n\nInput: look right twice and look around left.\n\n\"look right\" → turn right (I_TURN_RIGHT)\n\n\"twice\" → repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"look right\" twice = two instances of turn right: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nThen \"and\" means do the next part after: \"look around left\".\n\nAssuming \"look\" here is turn left (look left), then \"look around left\" would be \"around left\" applied to the verb \"turn left\".\n\nRule 3: [turn DIR + verb] four times. DIR is left, verb is turn left.\n\nSo each repetition is: turn left then turn left. So four times:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT repeated four times: eight actions.\n\nBut wait, the verb here would be turn left. So each repetition is [turn left (DIR) + verb (turn left)].\n\nSo combining all:\n\nFirst part: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSecond part: [I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT] repeated four times → I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT \n\nCombined:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT \n\nBut this seems odd. Alternatively, if \"look around left\" uses the verb \"look\", which is not a primitive, the command is invalid. However, given the need to provide an output:\n\nAssuming \"look\" in \"look around left\" is the verb \"turn left\", then \"around left\" would be four repetitions of [turn left + turn left].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look around left\" is ambiguous. But given the time constraints, here's the final answer:\n\nThe correct output would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT \n\nWait, no. Let's redo.\n\nIf \"look around left\" is \"around left\" with verb being \"turn left\", then according to rule 3, four repetitions:\n\nEach rep: turn left (DIR is left) + verb (turn left). So each rep is two left turns, repeated four times. Total eight actions.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst part \"look right twice\": I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nSecond part \"look around left\": [I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT] four times: 8 actions.\n\nCombined: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT \n\nBut wait, the \"and\" means do first then second part. So this should be the sequence. But I'm not confident due to the ambiguity in the command with non-primitive verbs. However, this is the best guess.", "model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this command step by step. The input is \"look right twice and look around left\". Hmm, first, I need to parse each part according to the rules provided.\n\nStarting with \"look right twice\". Wait, \"look\" isn't a primitive verb listed in the rules. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Oh, but the command here uses \"look right\". Wait, the rules mention that \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitives. So \"look right\" might be a bit ambiguous. Wait, but the example given uses \"jump around right\" which translates to turning right and jumping four times. So maybe \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\"? Because turning right would make you face that direction, which is looking that way. So perhaps \"look right\" is treated as \"turn right\".\n\nSo the first part: \"look right twice\" would be \"I_TURN_RIGHT\" twice? But wait, the rule says \"verb twice\" is repeating the verb sequence twice. So \"look right twice\" would be the verb \"turn right\" repeated twice. So each \"look right\" is a turn right, so twice would be two turns right. So that's I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nThen \"and\" means do the next part after this. The next part is \"look around left\". According to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb would be \"look\", which again, if \"look\" is equivalent to \"turn right\" or a different action? Wait, but the original problem states that primitive verbs are mapped to uppercase actions. The primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. Oh, this is a problem. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake here, or perhaps \"look\" is intended to be treated as a different action. But according to the rules, only the primitive verbs are mapped. So perhaps \"look around left\" isn't a valid primitive. Hmm. Wait, maybe \"look around left\" isn't using the primitive verbs, which might be an error, but the example uses \"jump around right\" which uses jump as a verb. So perhaps in this case, \"look\" here is intended to be a verb, but according to the rules, only the primitives are allowed. Wait, maybe \"look\" here is a typo, but since the user provided the command, I need to handle it as per the rules.\n\nWait, but the rules state that the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. So how to handle this? Maybe the command is invalid? But the user expects a response. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a mistake, but assuming that \"look right\" is supposed to be \"turn right\", then \"look right\" becomes I_TURN_RIGHT. Similarly, \"look around left\" would be \"around left\" applied to look. Wait, but \"look\" is not a primitive verb. So perhaps the command is invalid. However, the user provided the example where \"jump\" is the verb. So maybe \"look\" here is a mistake, but perhaps we have to proceed as if \"look\" is a verb, even if it's not in the primitives. Or maybe \"look\" is a different action.\n\nWait, the problem says that the agent is a semantic parsing agent for navigation commands, so maybe \"look\" is a valid action, but according to the rules given, only the verbs listed are mapped. Hmm. The problem states that \"Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions: walk→I_WALK, run→I_RUN, jump→I_JUMP, turn left→I_TURN_LEFT, turn right→I_TURN_RIGHT.\" So only those five. So \"look\" is not a primitive verb, which complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps \"look\" is a typo. Or maybe \"look around left\" is a way to refer to turning around and looking, but according to the rules, we can't use \"look\" as a verb. Therefore, maybe the command is invalid, but since the user provided it, perhaps there's a different interpretation. Alternatively, maybe \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\", so the verb is \"turn right\", and \"look around left\" is interpreted as \"around left\" applied to the verb \"turn left\"? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe the \"look right\" is a direction, but the primitive verbs are the only ones. So maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\" or \"run\" or \"jump\". Alternatively, perhaps the user intended \"look around left\" to be \"look around left\", which might mean turning left four times and looking each time, but without \"look\" being a valid action. Hmm. This seems like a problem. The input command is invalid, but according to the problem, we have to process it. Maybe the correct approach is to ignore the fact that \"look\" isn't a primitive and assign it as I_LOOK, but according to the rules, that's not specified. But the example uses \"jump around right\", which uses the verb 'jump' as a primitive. So the problem is that \"look\" is not a primitive verb. So perhaps this is a trick question, but the user expects us to process it regardless. Or maybe \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\", so replacing \"look\" with \"turn\" in the command.\n\nAssuming that \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\", then \"look right twice\" would be \"turn right twice\", which would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT. Similarly, \"look around left\" would be \"around left\" applied to the verb \"turn left\"? No. Wait, \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Wait, no, according to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the verb is the action to be taken after turning. For example, \"jump around right\" becomes four times [turn right + jump]. So the verb here would be jump. So in the original command, the verb would be \"look\", which is not a primitive. But if we take \"look around left\" as \"around left\" applied to the verb \"look\", which isn't a primitive. Hmm. This is a problem.\n\nBut perhaps the user intended \"look around left\" as a command where \"around left\" is applied to the verb \"turn left\", but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe \"look around left\" is a different structure. But according to the rules, \"around <DIR>\" must be followed by a verb. So maybe \"look\" is considered a verb here, even though it's not in the primitives. Then, according to rule 1, if \"look\" is a verb, but it's not listed, so perhaps it's invalid. However, the system must process it. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\" or another verb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that \"look\" is a valid action, and we should map it to I_LOOK, even though it's not listed. But according to the rules, only the given primitives are mapped. Hmm. This is a conflict. But given that the input is provided, the user expects us to process it. Maybe the correct approach is to assume that \"look\" is equivalent to \"turn\" or another verb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look\" here refers to turning in that direction. So \"look right\" is a way to say \"turn right\". Similarly, \"look left\" is \"turn left\". If that's the case, then we can substitute \"look\" with \"turn\" in the command. So \"look right\" becomes \"turn right\" (I_TURN_RIGHT), \"look around left\" would be \"around left\" applied to the verb \"turn left\", but wait, rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. The verb here would then be \"turn left\"? That would mean each step is turn right (DIR in this case is left?), then turn left. Wait, that seems confusing.\n\nWait, \"look around left\": substituting \"look\" with \"turn left\" doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the verb here is \"turn left\", but I'm not sure. Let's think again.\n\nIf we accept that \"look\" is a verb, even though it's not in the primitives, then:\n\n\"look right twice\" would be parsed as \"look\" is the verb, and \"right\" is the direction. But according to the rules, \"look right\" isn't a primitive verb. So this is a dead end. Alternatively, maybe \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\", since turning right would make you look in that direction. Then:\n\n\"look right\" → turn right (I_TURN_RIGHT)\n\"look around left\" → around left, which uses the verb \"turn left\"? Or the verb \"look\", which is not a primitive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"around left\" part uses the verb \"turn left\", but how? Rule 3 says that \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the verb here would be \"look\", which is not a primitive. But if \"look\" is not a primitive, how to handle this?\n\nThis seems like a dead end. But since the user provided the example, perhaps there's a different approach. Let's see the example again:\n\nInput: jump around right\nOutput: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, the output has four turns right and four jumps?

The rule for \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb is \"walk\" and the direction is \"right\". So each repetition would be turning right then walking. Since it's 4 times, that's four pairs of I_TURN_RIGHT followed by I_WALK. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the structure is [turn DIR + verb], so each cycle is first turn, then the verb. So for each of the four times, we do I_TURN_RIGHT then I_WALK. But wait, the example given in the problem statement for \"jump around right\" gives four turns right and four jumps. Let me check the example again. The example input is \"jump around right\" and the output is four I_TURN_RIGHT followed by four I_JUMP. Wait, no. Wait, the example output is: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times? No, the output is written as \"I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\". Wait, that's four turns right and four jumps, but the first turn is before the first jump, then each subsequent turn is before the next jump. So four turns and four jumps. Wait, the output has I_TURN_RIGHT four times and I_JUMP four times? Let me count. The example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (repeat four times?), but the way it's written is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP four times with the last action being I_TURN_RIGHT? Wait, the example output is written as:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, that's four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP?

Hmm, but the input is \"jump around right\", which according to the rules should be 4 repetitions of [turn right + jump]. Each repetition is turn then verb. So each repetition would be turn right, jump. Four times. That would be four turns and four jumps. So the output should be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times. Which would be 8 actions. But the example output given is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, that's four turns and three jumps. Hmm, that seems inconsistent. Wait, let's count:\n\nThe example output is written as:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSo each action is separated by spaces. Let's list each:\n\n1. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\n2. I_JUMP\n\n3. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\n4. I_JUMP\n\n5. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\n6. I_JUMP\n\n7. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSo total of 7 actions. Wait, that's three jumps. Because each [turn + jump] would be two actions. Four repetitions would be 4*(2) = 8 actions, but the example output only has seven. Hmm. Wait, maybe the example is missing something? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the rule.\n\nWait the problem statement says:\n\nExample:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSo that's three jumps? Because each repetition is [turn + verb], so four repetitions would be four turns and four verbs. Wait, but each repetition is [turn then verb], so four times [turn + jump], which would be four I_TURN_RIGHT and four I_JUMP. But the example output has three I_JUMP. So why?\n\nWait in the example output, there's four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP. Hmm. Wait, that doesn't align. So maybe the rule is that \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [verb then turn DIR]. Or perhaps the first turn is not part of the repetition. Wait, perhaps the example is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is written as four turns and three jumps. Which would make sense if the last turn is a correction. But according to rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Then each repetition starts with a turn. So four times, each time you turn then do the verb. So four turns, four verbs. But in the example, the output has four I_TURN_RIGHT and four I_JUMP. Wait, wait the example output as written has four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP? No:\n\nWait the output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nBreaking down:\n\nEach I_TURN_RIGHT is separated by spaces. So the sequence is:\n\nTurn right, Jump, Turn right, Jump, Turn right, Jump, Turn right.\n\nSo the number of I_TURN_RIGHT is four (positions 1,3,5,7), and I_JUMP is three (positions 2,4,6). So three jumps. But according to the rule, it should be four jumps. Because each repetition is [turn + verb], so four times. So this discrepancy suggests that the example might be incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the rule is different. Wait, perhaps the \"around\" rule is that after the four repetitions, the final turn is omitted? Or perhaps the example is a typo, but the user's example says that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is written correctly. Wait, perhaps the rule is that \"around\" requires 4 turns and 4 verbs, but the example has four turns and three verbs. Which would be conflicting. Hmm, perhaps the example is a mistake, but according to the problem statement, that's the example.\n\nWait, according to the example input and output:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWhich is four turns and three jumps. So that's three times [turn right, jump], and then a final turn. Which doesn't align with the rule of 4 repetitions. So maybe the problem statement's example is wrong? Or maybe the rule is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement's rule is that \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR] followed by the verb repeated 4 times. Or perhaps the verb is done once, then turn four times? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that \"around\" means to do four turns and one verb. But that's not logical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that \"around\" requires turning four times, then doing the verb four times. But that's not matching the example.\n\nWait, according to the problem's rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is turn then verb. So four times. So the total actions would be 4 turns and 4 verbs. So the example input \"jump around right\" should produce:\n\n[I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP] repeated four times. Which would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nBut according to the example output, it's seven actions, which ends with a turn. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nThis suggests that either the example is wrong, or the rule is being interpreted differently. Maybe the original rule is that \"around\" means to turn four times and then do the verb four times. Which would be different. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement's example is correct, but the rule is that \"around right\" is four turns right (each 90 degrees, totaling 360) and during each turn, after turning, you do the verb. So for example, each time you turn right, then do the verb once. So four turns right and four verbs. But the example output ends with a turn right. Which would mean that after the fourth verb, you turn again. That would not align with the rule.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. But since the example provided by the problem statement ends with a turn right, perhaps the \"around\" rule is that after each verb, you turn, except the last one. Or perhaps the number of turns is four, and the verbs are three. But that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is a typo. But the user has given us that example, so we have to follow it. Let's see:\n\nIn the example, the input is \"jump around right\", which according to rule 3 should produce four repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So each repetition is two actions. So four times two is eight actions total. But the example output is seven actions. Which ends with a turn right. Which would imply that the four repetitions are [turn right + jump], but the final turn right is an extra. But that doesn't fit the rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"around\" rule is that you turn four times (each 90 degrees) to make a full circle, and during each turn (each 90 degrees), you do the verb once. So the total rotation is 360 degrees. So each turn right (90) and then verb. Four times. So four turns and four jumps. But the example output shows four turns and three jumps. Which would suggest that after the four turns and three jumps, the example is missing a jump. But according to the problem's example, it's written that way.

The input is \"jump opposite left thrice after turn around right twice\". Hmm, first, I need to break down each part according to the rules.\n\nStarting with \"jump opposite left thrice\". Opposite left means two turns left, then the verb. So opposite left would be I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT. Then jump, so after those two turns, do I_JUMP. But then it says \"thrice\", which means repeat the whole sequence three times. Wait, wait. Wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of turn DIR plus verb. Rule 3: around right would be turn right and jump four times. Wait, but in this case, the user has \"opposite left\" which is two lefts, then jump. Then \"thrice\" applies to the entire opposite left jump sequence. So \"jump opposite left thrice\" means doing [I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP] three times. But wait, the \"opposite left\" is the direction modifier for the jump. So the structure is jump (opposite left) done thrice.\n\nBut wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions. But \"opposite left\" isn't around; it's a different modifier. So opposite left is two left turns. So each time you do opposite left jump, you turn left twice, then jump. Then \"thrice\" means do that sequence three times. So \"jump opposite left thrice\" would be [I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP] repeated three times. So that's three times the three actions.\n\nNow, the command is \"jump opposite left thrice after turn around right twice\". According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So here, A is \"jump opposite left thrice\", B is \"turn around right twice\". Wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure is: [jump opposite left thrice] after [turn around right twice]. So the entire B part is \"turn around right twice\", and the A part is \"jump opposite left thrice\". Therefore, we do B first, then A.\n\nSo first, parse \"turn around right twice\". Let's see: \"turn around right\" is turn right around. Rule 3: around right is 4 repetitions of turn right and verb. But the verb here is turn. Wait, wait. Wait, the phrase is \"turn around right\". Hmm. Let's parse that. \"around right\" applies to the verb \"turn\". So \"turn around right\" would be the verb \"turn\" modified by \"around right\". But according to rule 3, \"around right\" means 4 repetitions of [turn right + verb]. The verb here is \"turn\", so each time you turn right, then do turn. Wait, but that's confusing. Let me think.\n\nOriginal phrase: \"turn around right twice\". Wait, the original command's B part is \"turn around right twice\"? Wait, the entire part after \"after\" is \"turn around right twice\". So the full command is \"jump opposite left thrice after turn around right twice\", which breaks down as A after B, where A is \"jump opposite left thrice\" and B is \"turn around right twice\".\n\nSo first process B: \"turn around right twice\". Let's parse \"turn around right\". The verb is \"turn\", and \"around right\" modifies it. According to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" becomes 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So here, the verb is \"turn\", so each repetition would be [turn right + turn]. Then 4 times. Wait, but this would be a bit recursive. Hmm. Let me make sure.\n\nRule 3 says: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the verb here is \"turn\", so each cycle would be turn DIR (right), then do the verb (turn). But \"turn\" again? So \"turn around right\" would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN, done four times. So that's four times [I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN]. Then \"twice\" (from \"turn around right twice\") would mean repeating that entire around sequence twice. Because \"around right twice\" here: wait, no. Wait, the \"twice\" applies to the around right. Wait, the phrase is \"turn around right twice\". The \"twice\" applies to the entire around right action. So \"around right twice\" would be the around right done twice? Or wait, the structure is \"turn around right twice\". Hmm. Let's clarify.\n\nWait, the \"twice\" applies to the verb. Let's parse \"turn around right twice\". The verb is \"turn\", modified by \"around right\", then the \"twice\" applies to the entire around right action. Wait, according to rule 4, \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions. Then \"twice\" would mean that the entire around right action (which is 4 repetitions) is done twice. So \"around right twice\" would be 2 repetitions of the around right, each of which is 4 repetitions. Wait, no. Wait, the \"twice\" applies to the verb. Wait, in the example, \"jump around right\" gives four turns and jumps. So \"around right\" is 4 repetitions. Then \"jump around right thrice\" would be \"jump around right\" thrice? Or is \"jump around right\" already the action. Wait, the example given in rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions. So if the verb is \"jump\", then \"jump around right\" would be [turn right, jump] four times.\n\nSo, in the current case, the B part is \"turn around right twice\". So the verb is \"turn\", modified by \"around right\", then \"twice\" meaning the entire around right sequence is done twice. Wait, the \"twice\" applies to the verb. Wait, rule 4 says: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat verb twice. So in \"turn around right twice\", the verb is \"turn around right\", then \"twice\" meaning repeat that entire action twice.\n\nWait, but \"turn around right\" itself is a modified verb. So \"turn around right\" would be the action, then \"twice\" would repeat that action twice. So first, parse \"turn around right\": according to rule 3, \"around right\" applied to \"turn\" would be 4 repetitions of [turn right + turn]. So that's four times [I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN]. Then \"twice\" would mean repeat that entire around right action twice. So the total for B is: [I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN] repeated four times, then that entire thing repeated twice? Wait, no. Wait, no, the \"twice\" here is outside the around. Wait, confusion here. Let's parse:\n\nOriginal command for B: \"turn around right twice\". The verb is \"turn\", modified by \"around right\", then \"twice\" meaning repeat the entire around right modified verb twice.\n\nRule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions. So \"turn around right\" would be 4 repetitions of [turn right + turn]. Then \"twice\" would multiply that by two. Wait, but according to rule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So the verb here is \"turn around right\", which itself is a sequence of 4 repetitions. So \"turn around right twice\" would be that entire 4-repetition sequence done twice. So each time you do the around right, which is four [turn right + turn], then do that twice. So total of 8 actions: [I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN] repeated four times, then again four times.\n\nWait, but rule 4 says \"twice\" repeats the verb. But the verb in \"turn around right\" is modified, so the entire modified verb (which is a sequence of actions) is repeated twice. So yes.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nB part: \"turn around right twice\" is [around right] * 2. Around right is [turn right + turn] *4. So:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN repeated 4 times (from around right), then that entire around right done twice? Or wait, no. Wait, the \"around right\" is the same as rule 3. So \"turn around right\" would be:\n\n[turn right, turn] repeated four times. Then \"twice\" would mean that instead of doing that once, we do it twice? Because the \"twice\" is modifying the entire verb. So \"turn around right twice\" would be doing the around right twice. So the total for B is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN (four times above) and then again the same for the second around right. So total 8 actions.\n\nWait, no. Wait, \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"turn around right\" is 4 times [turn right, turn]. So each repetition is two actions. So total 4 * 2 = 8 actions. Then \"twice\" would mean repeat the entire around right action two times. So 8 * 2 = 16 actions? That seems a lot, but according to rule 4, if you have a verb that's modified by something else, then \"twice\" would repeat the entire sequence. For example, in the example given, \"jump around right\" is 4 repetitions. If that's modified by \"twice\", it would be 8.\n\nBut according to the problem statement's rules, rule 4 says", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 50, "model_reflection": "The original response incorrectly interprets the phrase 'turn around right twice'.

Instead, the correct interpretation of 'around' is to perform the verb while turning in the specified direction four times. Therefore, 'turn around right' should be interpreted as four repetitions of I_TURN_RIGHT followed by the verb I_TURN once per cycle, not pairing I_TURN_RIGHT with a separate I_TURN.

So \"A after B\" translates to doing B first, then A. So according to rule 6, \"walk opposite right after jump opposite left\" means first do \"jump opposite left\", then do \"walk opposite right\".\n\nNow, let's handle each part. \n\nStarting with \"jump opposite left\". The term \"opposite left\" means two turns in the left direction followed by the verb. So opposite left would be two left turns. According to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, wait. Wait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" is equivalent to two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no. Wait, the description says: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Hmm, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the original rule says: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, but that might be confusing. Let me recheck.\n\nRule 2 says: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, that's a bit unclear. Wait, perhaps it's two turns in the opposite direction? Or does \"opposite left\" mean two turns left? Because the user wrote \"opposite left\", which would be two left turns. Let me think. The example given in the rules is that \"opposite right\" would be two right turns. For example, if the command was \"walk opposite right\", it would be two right turns and then walk. So \"opposite left\" would be two left turns, then the verb.\n\nWait, but the rule says \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So the direction specified in the command is DIR, and you do two turns in DIR. So \"opposite right\" would mean turn right twice, then perform the verb. So \"jump opposite left\" would be two left turns then jump. Then \"walk opposite right\" would be two right turns then walk.\n\nSo for \"jump opposite left\": two left turns, then jump. Then \"walk opposite right\": two right turns, then walk.\n\nBut the command is \"jump opposite left\" after \"walk opposite right\", which because of \"after\", we need to reverse the order. So first do \"jump opposite left\", then \"walk opposite right\".\n\nWait no: the original input is \"walk opposite right after jump opposite left\". According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means B then A. So A is \"walk opposite right\", B is \"jump opposite left\". So execute B then A.\n\nTherefore, first do \"jump opposite left\", then do \"walk opposite right\".\n\nNow, breaking each part:\n\nFirst part: \"jump opposite left\" → opposite left is two left turns, then jump. So I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_JUMP.\n\nSecond part: \"walk opposite right\" → two right turns, then walk. So I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_WALK.\n\nPutting it all together: B (jump opposite left) followed by A (walk opposite right). So the sequence would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK.\n\nWait, but wait, are there any other rules that apply? For example, does the \"opposite\" affect the number of turns? Let me confirm. Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. So yes, two turns in the specified direction. So that's correct.\n\nSo the final sequence would be the combination of the two parts. So the entire output would be the actions from \"jump opposite left\" followed by \"walk opposite right\".\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nJump opposite left → two left turns then jump. So:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nThen walk opposite right → two right turns then walk:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK\n\nCombined together, separated by spaces:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK\n\nI don't see any other modifiers here.

The input is \"run around right twice and jump around left\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part. The main components are \"run around right twice\" and \"jump around left\", connected by \"and\", which according to rule 5 means do A then B in order.\n\nStarting with \"run around right twice\". The \"around right\" part follows rule 3: 4 repetitions of [turn right + verb]. So \"run around right\" would be turning right and running four times. Then \"twice\" applies rule 4, repeating the entire sequence twice. So each \"run around right\" is four steps, so two times would be 4*2=8 actions. Wait, no: rule 4 says \"twice\" repeats the verb sequence twice. So the \"run around right\" is a sequence itself. So first, expand \"run around right\" into its parts, then repeat that entire sequence twice.\n\nBreaking down \"run around right\": according to rule 3, around right means 4 repetitions of [turn right + run]. So each repetition is I_TURN_RIGHT followed by I_RUN. So four times would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN\n\nThen \"twice\" would repeat that entire sequence again. So the same 8 actions again. So total for \"run around right twice\" would be 8 * 2 = 16 actions.\n\nNext part is \"jump around left\". Rule 3 again: around left means four repetitions of [turn left + jump]. So each cycle is I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP. Four times would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nNow, since the original command is \"run around right twice and jump around left\", we need to do the first part (run around right twice) followed by the second part (jump around left). \n\nPutting it all together: the first part (run around right twice) gives 8 actions, then the second part (jump around left) gives 8 actions, so total of 16 + 8 = 24 actions. Wait, wait, wait: no. Wait, \"run around right\" is four repetitions, which is 4*(turn right + run), which is 8 actions. Then \"twice\" would repeat that entire \"run around right\" sequence twice, so 8 * 2 = 16 actions. Then \"jump around left\" is four repetitions of turn left + jump, which is 8 actions. So total is 16 + 8 = 24.\n\nLet me verify each step again. Let's start with the first part:\n\nOriginal command: run around right twice.\n\n- around right: rule 3. So 4 repetitions of [turn right + run]. Each repetition is two actions. 4 * 2 = 8 actions.\n\n- then \"twice\" applies to the entire \"run around right\" sequence. So repeat the 8 actions again. So total 8 * 2 = 16 actions.\n\nThen the second part: jump around left.\n\n- around left: rule 3. 4 repetitions of [turn left + jump]. Each repetition two actions. 4 * 2 = 8 actions.\n\nThe \"and\" combines both parts, so first part (run around right twice) then jump around left. So total 16 + 8 = 24 actions.\n\nNow, writing out all the actions:\n\nFirst part:\n\nrun around right twice:\n\nFirst \"run around right\" (8 actions):\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN\n\nThen repeated again (same 8 actions):\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN\n\nThen \"jump around left\" (8 actions):\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nPutting all together with spaces between each action:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nWait, but wait, the first part has two repetitions of \"run around right\", which each have four turns and runs. So the first run around right is four times, then the second run around right again four times. So the entire first part is 8 runs of turn right and run.\n\nSo the first part is 16 actions (8 repetitions of two actions each), then the second part is 8 actions. So total 24 actions.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let me check if any other rules apply. For example, \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. But in \"run around right twice\", the \"run around right\" is the verb sequence. So each \"run around right\" is four repetitions. So repeating that twice would be two times four, making eight repetitions of turn right and run. But no, no, wait: no, the structure is \"run around right\" which itself is a compound action (four times turn right + run). Then \"twice\" would repeat that entire compound action again. So the total would be two times the \"run around right\" sequence, each of which is four turns and runs.\n\nTherefore, the first part is eight actions (four per run around right * two times). Then the second part is eight actions for the jump around left.\n\nSo the final output is all those actions in order, separated by spaces.\n", "rationality_label": "Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 65, "model_reflection": "The original response over-applies the 'around right' interpretation for 'run around right twice'.

Rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb is \"run\" which becomes I_RUN, and DIR is left. So each around left would be turning left then running, four times. But then there's \"thrice\", which according to rule 4 means repeat the verb sequence three times. Wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 reps of [turn DIR + verb], and \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. Wait, the structure here might be that \"run around left thrice\" would be the \"around left\" sequence (which is four repetitions) multiplied by three? Or does \"thrice\" apply to the entire \"around left\" action?\n\nWait, the example in the problem statement's rules might clarify. Let's check the example again. The example input is \"jump around right\", output is four repetitions of turn right and jump, so \"around\" already accounts for four turns and jumps. Then \"jump around right thrice\" would be three times the entire around sequence? Or does \"around\" already have the four repetitions, and \"thrice\" multiplies that?\n\nWait, looking at the example given: \"jump around right\" becomes four repetitions of turn right and jump, as per rule 3. So the \"around\" already includes four repetitions. Then if there's a \"thrice\" after that, like \"run around left thrice\", that would mean that the entire \"around left\" action (which is four repetitions) is done three times. But wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Then rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is that four times. Then rule 5 applies when there's a \"twice\" or \"thrice\"—so \"<verb> twice\" is repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, but \"run around left thrice\" — the \"around left\" is a single verb sequence? Or is \"run around left\" the verb phrase modified by \"thrice\"?\n\nHmm. Let's parse \"run around left thrice\". The structure is probably \"run around left\" as the verb phrase, modified by \"thrice\". According to rule 4, \"around left\" would be four repetitions of [turn left + run]. Then \"thrice\" would mean that the entire \"run around left\" sequence is repeated three times. Wait, but rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions. Then \"run around left\" is equivalent to four [turn left + run]. Then adding \"thrice\" would mean that the entire four-step sequence is done three times. Because rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions, and \"thrice\" would apply to the verb, which in this case is \"run around left\"—but maybe \"around\" already includes the repetitions. Wait, perhaps the \"thrice\" would multiply the entire \"run around left\" which itself has four repetitions. So \"run around left thrice\" would be 3 times (four repetitions of turn left then run). So that would be 3 * 4 = 12 actions. Let me confirm:\n\nOriginal example: \"jump around right\" → four repetitions. So \"around\" is four times. If the input was \"jump around right twice\", then per rule 4, \"around\" is four times, then \"twice\" would mean repeat that twice. So total would be 2 times the four repetitions. So \"jump around right twice\" would be eight repetitions. Or wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions. Then rule 4 says that \"around\" is four times. Then rule 5 says \"A and B\" is order. Rule 4 says \"twice\" is repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"run around left thrice\" would be the verb sequence \"run around left\" repeated thrice. Wait, but \"run around left\" itself is a verb (run) combined with around, which is a structure. So maybe \"run around left\" is a single action composed of four repetitions. Then \"thrice\" would mean that the entire \"run around left\" action is done three times. So each time you do \"run around left\", you have four turns left and four runs. Then doing it three times would be 3 times four repetitions. So total 3 * (turn left, run, turn left, run, etc. four times each). But how would that sequence be structured? Let's take another example. Suppose input is \"walk twice\", then output is I_WALK I_WALK. If input is \"walk around right twice\", then each \"walk around right\" is four repetitions of turn right and walk, so doing that twice would be each around right (four times) multiplied by two. So each around right done twice. So the output would be two iterations of the around right sequence. Let's think:\n\n\"walk around right twice\" would be:\n\n[turn right, walk, turn right, walk, turn right, walk, turn right, walk] (four times) → that's once around. Then \"twice\" would repeat that entire around sequence again. So total of 8 actions (each around is 4 turns+walk pairs, so 8 actions per around? Wait, each around right is four times [turn right + walk], so each around is four turns and four walks. So each around is 8 actions. Wait, no: each repetition is a turn and a walk. So each around right would be four repetitions of [turn right then walk], which would be 4 turns and 4 walks. So the total actions per \"around right\" is 8: four turns, four walks. Then \"twice\" would make it 16 actions. But according to the example given, \"jump around right\" gives four turns and four jumps. Wait, the example output for \"jump around right\" is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times, then the output is four times the pair. So each around right is four pairs of turn and jump. So the example output is 4 pairs: 4 turns and 4 jumps. So total of 8 actions. So each around is four pairs. So \"around <DIR>\" gives four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb], which would be two actions each, four times. So four turns and four verbs. So each around is eight actions. Then \"thrice\" would multiply that by three. So \"run around left thrice\" would be three times the entire around left sequence, which is four pairs. So each around left is four pairs. So \"run around left thrice\" would be three times four pairs. So total 12 pairs (3*4=12). Therefore, the \"run around left thrice\" would generate 12 pairs of turn left and run. Wait, no. Wait, each around left is four repetitions of [turn left + run], so each around is four times two actions. So each around is 4 * 2 = 8 actions. Then \"thrice\" would multiply that into 3 * 8 actions = 24 actions. Wait, but how does that fit into the example given? Let's check the example again:\n\nInput: \"jump around right\" → output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, wait, in the example output, the final action is I_TURN_RIGHT. Wait, that's strange. Wait, according to the example output:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times? Or wait, the output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times? Let's count the number of actions. The output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, that's seven actions. Let me count:\n\n1. I_TURN_RIGHT\n2. I_JUMP\n3. I_TURN_RIGHT\n4. I_JUMP\n5. I_TURN_RIGHT\n6. I_JUMP\n7. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nHmm. So here, there are three I_JUMP actions. Because each turn right followed by jump, except the last turn right. Wait, the example output shows that \"jump around right\" becomes four turns right and three jumps. That contradicts the initial understanding. Wait, perhaps the around rule is that \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR then verb], so each time, turn DIR then do the verb. Then, after four such steps, you end up facing the original direction. But if the verb is jump, then each jump happens after a turn.

The input is \"turn around right and turn opposite right twice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part separately and then combine them according to the rules. \n\nStarting with \"turn around right\". The rule for \"around <DIR>\" is that it's four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb is \"turn\", but wait, the original command says \"turn around right\". Wait, no. Wait, \"around right\" applies to the verb. Wait, no. Wait, the structure here: \"turn around right\" would be parsed as \"around right\" modifying the verb \"turn\". Wait, no. Wait, the original command is \"turn around right and turn opposite right twice\". Let's split into the two parts:\n\nFirst part: \"turn around right\" — wait, no. Wait, the original command is \"turn around right and ...\". Hmm. Wait, the first part is \"turn around right\"? Or is it \"around right\" applied to \"turn\"? Or is the verb \"turn around\"? Hmm, no. The correct parsing is that \"around right\" is a modifier for the verb. Wait, according to rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the verb here is \"turn\". Wait, but \"turn\" is the verb here, so \"turn around right\" would be parsed as:\n\n\"Around right\" applied to the verb \"turn\". So according to rule 3, this would be 4 times [turn right + turn]. Wait, but \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitives that map to I_TURN_LEFT and I_TURN_RIGHT. But the verb here is \"turn\". Wait, but the original command is \"turn around right\", so the verb is \"turn\" followed by \"around right\". Wait, no. Wait, \"around right\" is a modifier. So \"turn around right\" would be equivalent to \"around right\" modifying the verb \"turn\". So according to rule 3, each iteration is [turn right + turn]. Wait, but \"turn\" is a verb, but in the rules, \"primitive verbs\" are words like walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Wait, rule 1 says that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitive verbs. Wait, so \"turn\" alone is not a primitive verb. Hmm, this might complicate things. Wait, looking back at the rules:\n\nRule 1: Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. The examples given are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are each primitive verbs. But \"turn\" alone isn't listed. So if the command has a verb that's not a primitive, perhaps it's invalid? But in the problem statement, we have to process the command regardless.\n\nWait, but in the example, \"jump around right\" is processed into the actions. So in that case, the verb is jump. Then, \"around right\" means that each step is turn right and jump. So in the current problem, the first part of the command is \"turn around right\". Wait, but \"turn\" here is not a primitive verb. Wait, the primitive verbs are only walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn\" alone isn't a primitive verb. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, perhaps \"turn\" in this context is part of a larger primitive verb. Let's check the command again: \"turn around right and turn opposite right twice\".\n\nBreaking down the first part: \"turn around right\". The \"around right\" is a modifier. The verb here would be \"turn\", which is not a primitive verb. Because the primitives are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\", not \"turn\". So perhaps this is a problem. Wait, but maybe \"turn around right\" is parsed differently. Wait, maybe \"around right\" applies to the verb \"turn left\" or \"turn right\". Wait, but the command is \"turn around right\". Maybe \"around\" here is not a modifier but part of the verb? No, according to the rules, \"around <DIR>\" is a modifier. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the command, but we have to parse according to the rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"turn around right\" is equivalent to \"walk around right\", but the verb here is \"turn\". Hmm. But according to the rules, we need to see if \"turn\" is a verb. Wait, the example uses \"jump around right\", which works because \"jump\" is a primitive verb. So in our problem, \"turn\" here is not a primitive verb, but according to the problem's rules, perhaps \"turn\" isn't a valid primitive. Wait, but the problem's rules list \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" as primitives. So \"turn\" alone is not a primitive verb. Therefore, \"turn around right\" would be invalid? But since the problem gives us this input, we must parse it.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended \"turn around right\" as a command. Let's consider that \"turn\" is not a primitive, but the actual primitive is \"turn left\" or \"turn right\". So how to parse \"turn around right\"? Maybe \"around right\" applies to a verb that is \"turn left\" or \"turn right\"? Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the first part of the command is \"turn around right\" which would be parsed as \"around right\" modifying the verb \"turn\". But \"turn\" isn't a primitive. This seems like a problem. Alternatively, maybe \"turn around\" is a different verb, but according to the rules, it's not listed. Hmm. Maybe the user made a mistake here, but we have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"turn around right\" is equivalent to \"turn right around right\", but that doesn't make sense. Let's think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem's command has two separate parts:\n\nThe first part is \"turn around right\", which might be parsed as \"around right\" applied to the verb \"turn\", which would generate four repetitions of [turn right + turn]. But since \"turn\" is not a valid primitive, perhaps \"turn\" here is invalid. But maybe the problem expects us to treat \"turn\" as a verb. Wait, but according to the rules, only the ones listed in rule 1 are primitives. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but the system must process it. Alternatively, maybe \"turn around right\" is a misstatement, and the intended verb is \"walk\" or something else. But we can't assume that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the verb in the first part is \"turn right\", but the \"around right\" would then apply to that verb. Let's try this.\n\nWait, \"turn around right\" would be parsed as \"around right\" applied to the verb \"turn\". But \"turn\" is not a primitive verb. Alternatively, the verb is \"turn left\" or \"turn right\", but the command says \"turn around right\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part of the command is \"turn around right\" meaning that you turn around (180 degrees), which would be two turns right (or left), but according to the rules, \"around right\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Hmm. Maybe the problem's first part is \"turn around right\" which would be parsed as follows: the verb is \"turn right\", and \"around right\" is modifying it. Wait, but that's not possible because \"around right\" would require the verb to be preceded by a turn right. Not sure.\n\nThis is confusing. Let's take a step back.\n\nThe input command is \"turn around right and turn opposite right twice\"\n\nWe need to parse each part.\n\nFirst part: \"turn around right\" — perhaps the verb is \"turn\", and \"around right\" is a modifier. According to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" becomes 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So here, the verb is \"turn\", DIR is right. So each step would be [I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN], repeated four times. But wait, \"turn\" is not a primitive verb. So according to rule 1, how does \"turn\" map to an action? The rules list \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" as primitives. Therefore, \"turn\" alone is not a valid primitive. Therefore, this would be an invalid command? But the problem expects us to process it. Maybe \"turn\" here is a mistake, but the intended verb is \"walk\" or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended \"turn around right\" as a way to turn around (two turns). But according to the rules, we have to follow the given syntax.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first part is \"turn around\" as a verb, but that's not covered by the rules. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the command is structured as \"turn (around right)\" and \"turn (opposite right twice)\", but that may not be correct.\n\nWait, the first part of the command is \"turn around right\". Let's parse \"around right\" as a modifier. The structure \"around <DIR>\" applies to the verb. So the verb here must be a primitive verb. The possible primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right.\n\nSo the verb here must be one of these. But \"turn\" alone is not a verb. So the verb in the first part could be \"turn left\" or \"turn right\". Wait, but the command says \"turn around right\". So perhaps \"turn around right\" is parsed as \"around right\" modifying the verb \"turn left\" or \"turn right\"? But how?\n\nWait, perhaps \"turn", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 55, "model_reflection": "The original parsing incorrectly interpreted 'turn' as a primitive verb when in fact, according to Rule 1, only specific verbs like walk, run, jump, turn left, and turn right are valid primitives.

The user wants me to process \"run opposite left thrice after jump opposite left twice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the structure. The main clause is \"run opposite left thrice after jump opposite left twice\". According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So the overall structure is: first do the jump part, then the run part.\n\nStarting with the jump part: \"jump opposite left twice\". Let's decompose this. \"opposite left\" means two turns in the left direction, which would be two I_TURN_LEFT actions. Then you perform the verb, which is jump. But since it's \"twice\", rule 4 says that \"verb twice\" means repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, no, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions. Wait, rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"jump opposite left twice\" would be: each \"opposite left\" is two turns left, then jump. And doing that twice. Wait, no. Wait, \"opposite left\" is two turns left followed by the verb. Then \"twice\" applies to that entire sequence.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The phrase \"jump opposite left twice\" would parse as: the verb is \"jump\", modified by \"opposite left\", which according to rule 2: \"opposite left\" = two turns left then the verb. But since it's \"twice\", does \"twice\" apply to the entire \"opposite left\" sequence? So \"opposite left\" becomes two turns left + jump, and doing that twice. Wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb], but rule 4 is for \"around\". Rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"jump twice\" would be I_JUMP I_JUMP. But in this case, the verb itself is modified by \"opposite left\". So \"jump opposite left\" would be the sequence: I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP. Then adding \"twice\" would mean repeating that entire sequence twice. So for the jump part: \"jump opposite left twice\" becomes [I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP] repeated twice. So that's I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP.\n\nThen the run part: \"run opposite left thrice\". Similarly, \"run opposite left\" would be two left turns followed by run. Then \"thrice\" means repeating that entire sequence three times. So each time it's two left turns and a run, done three times. So each \"opposite left\" followed by run, thrice. So each cycle is I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN, and this done three times. Therefore, the run part would be I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN.\n\nNow, according to the \"after\" rule (rule 6), we need to do the jump part first, then the run part. So combining both sequences:\n\nJump part:\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nThen run part:\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\n\nPutting them all together in order:\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\n\nWait, but let me check again. The original command is \"run opposite left thrice after jump opposite left twice\". So the entire \"run opposite left thrice\" comes after the jump part. So yes, the jump part is \"jump opposite left twice\", which is two times (two turns left + jump), then the run part is three times (two turns left + run). So the total sequence would be:\n\nJump part:\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (twice) → so two times the sequence.\n\nRun part:\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN (thrice) → three times the sequence.\n\nCombined: jump_part + run_part.\n\nWait, but according to rule 6: \"A after B\" = do B then A. So the run part (A) is after the jump part (B), so first B (jump) then A (run). Therefore, the correct order is jump_part followed by run_part.\n\nSo the output should be the concatenation of jump_part and run_part. Let me write them out:\n\nJump_part (jump opposite left twice):\nEach \"opposite left\" is two left turns then jump. Then \"twice\" → two times that.\n\nSo first \"opposite left\" → I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\nSecond time → same again → I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nSo jump_part = I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nRun_part (run opposite left thrice):\nEach \"opposite left\" is two left turns then run. \"thrice\" → three times.\n\nFirst: I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\nSecond: same\nThird: same\n\nSo run_part = I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\n\nCombined, the total sequence is:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\n\nLet me check if this is correct. Are there any other modifiers or rules that might affect this?\n\nAnother way: Let's parse the entire command step by step.\n\nThe command is: run opposite left thrice after jump opposite left twice.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nThe entire command is structured as \"A after B\", where:\n\nA = run opposite left thrice\n\nB = jump opposite left twice\n\nTherefore, according to rule 6, do B then A.\n\nNow, processing B: jump opposite left twice.\n\n\"opposite left\" → two turns left, then the verb (jump). So \"jump opposite left\" is two left turns, then jump. Then \"twice\" → repeat this entire sequence twice. Wait, no: rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" → repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, in this case, \"jump opposite left\" is the verb sequence modified by opposite left, then \"twice\" applies to that. Wait, the \"twice\" applies to the entire verb phrase. So \"jump opposite left twice\" would be doing \"jump opposite left\" twice. Which would be each time: two left turns, jump. So twice → two times that sequence.\n\nSimilarly, \"run opposite left thrice\" → three times: two left turns, run.\n\nTherefore, the previous breakdown is correct.\n\nSo the final action sequence is B followed by A.\n\nB: two times [two lefts, jump]\n\nA: three times [two lefts, run]\n\nThus the combined sequence is:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\n\nEach sequence of I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT is two lefts, followed by the verb, then repeated.\n\nYes, that seems correct.", "rationality_label": "Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The original response correctly parses the command according to the defined rules.

The phrase \"run left\" probably means turning left and then running. But wait, according to rule 1, \"turn left\" maps to I_TURN_LEFT. But the user wrote \"run left\", so is that a turn left followed by run? Wait, no, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"run left\" might actually be \"turn left then run\"? Wait, but the rules say that primitive verbs map directly. Hmm. Wait, the original example has \"jump around right\" which becomes I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times. Wait, no, the example for \"jump around right\" is that each step is turn right and jump four times. But in the example, \"jump around right\" becomes I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times, which suggests that \"around right\" is four times [turn right + verb]. So the verb here is \"jump\", so each cycle is turn right then jump. So \"jump around right\" would be [turn right, jump] four times.\n\nSo back to \"run left twice\". Wait, the problem is \"run left\" – does that mean turn left and then run? Because according to the rules, the primitive verbs are mapped directly. So \"run\" is I_RUN. But \"run left\" – maybe that's a direction? Wait, but the rules don't mention direction modifiers except for the turn left/right. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me recheck the rules.\n\nRule 1 says that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. The examples are \"turn left\" → I_TURN_LEFT, \"turn right\" → I_TURN_RIGHT. So \"walk\", \"run\", \"jump\" are primitives, but their direction must come from combining with turn. Wait, perhaps \"run left\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, the primitive verbs are the ones listed: walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So the verbs are run, walk, jump, and the turns. So \"run left\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, perhaps the command is \"run (in some direction)\" modified by \"left\"? But according to the rules, how are directions handled? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure of the commands. \n\nWait, looking at the example: \"jump around right\" becomes two turns right and jump each time? No, the example output is four repetitions of [turn right, jump], then the last turn right. Wait, the example output for \"jump around right\" is I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times, but in the example given, the output is I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT. Wait, wait, the example input \"jump around right\" outputs:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, no, looking at the example:\n\nInput: jump around right\n\nOutput: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, the output is four turns right and three jumps? Wait, the example output seems to have four turns and three jumps. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the example says:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nBreaking that down: Each [turn right + jump] is done four times? No, because after each turn right, you jump. Wait, the output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (1st)\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (2nd)\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (3rd)\nI_TURN_RIGHT (4th?)\n\nWait, no. Let's count:\n\nThe output sequence is:\n\n1. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\n2. I_JUMP\n\n3. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\n4. I_JUMP\n\n5. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\n6. I_JUMP\n\n7. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, that's three jumps and four turns right. Hmm, the rule says \"around <DIR> = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb].\" So \"around right\" would be four times [turn right then jump]. So each cycle is turn right, jump. So four times would be four turns and four jumps, but in the example output, it's:\n\nTurn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right.\n\nWait, that's four turns and three jumps. That doesn't align. Wait, that's 4 turns right, but only three jumps. Hmm. Wait, this suggests that maybe the example is wrong. Wait, no, perhaps the rule is that \"around\" means turn DIR and then do the verb four times. Or maybe the example in the problem statement is a typo. Let me check again.\n\nThe example input is \"jump around right\", and the output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right.\n\nWhich is four turns and three jumps. But according to rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is two actions. So four repetitions would be 4 turns and 4 verbs. So four times [turn + verb] would be 8 actions. But the example output has 7 actions: four turns and three jumps. Hmm. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is wrong? Or perhaps the rule is different. Wait, looking at the example again: \"jump around right\" produces four turns right and three jumps. Let me count:\n\nThe output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP \n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP \n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP \n\nI_TURN_RIGHT \n\nSo each of the first three jumps are after a turn, and then the fourth turn doesn't have a jump. So perhaps the rule is that \"around\" means to do the turn followed by the verb four times, but the example output is wrong? Or perhaps the rule was intended to be three times? But the problem states rule 3 as 4 repetitions. Hmm. This is confusing. Maybe the example is correct, and the rule is that \"around\" means to turn DIR four times, each followed by the verb, except the last one. Wait, but how to resolve this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"around <DIR>\" means to turn DIR four times, each followed by the verb, but the example output is missing an action. But the user's example must be taken as correct. Therefore, maybe the actual rule is that \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR], then the verb. Or perhaps the example is a mistake, but given that, perhaps the intended rule is that \"around\" is four turns, each followed by the verb. But in the example, it's three turns and three jumps. No, not sure. Alternatively, maybe \"around\" is four times the sequence [turn DIR and verb], but in the example, the output is four turns and three verbs. Wait, the example output has four turns and three verbs. So maybe the last verb is omitted. But that's unclear.\n\nThis is a problem. But perhaps the correct approach is to follow the rule as stated, not the example. Wait, the rule says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is two actions. So four times would be eight actions. For the example input \"jump around right\", the verb is jump, so each repetition is turn right, jump. Four times would be 4 turns and 4 jumps, so the output should be I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP four times, which would be 8 actions. But the example output is seven actions. Therefore, there's a contradiction. But the user provided the example, so we must align with that. Therefore, perhaps the rule is that after each turn, you do the verb, except the last turn. So four turns, three verbs. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the example's output is missing a jump. Hmm. This complicates things.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that the example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated three times, followed by a single I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nSo total of 3 jumps and 4 turns. So total of 7 actions.\n\nWhich would be the output for three [turn right, jump] sequences and then a final turn right. So how does that align with the rule? Maybe the rule is that \"around <DIR>\" is 4 turns, each followed by the verb except the last one. But that complicates the rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is correct, and the rule's wording is ambiguous. So perhaps \"around\" is four times the turn, and then perform the verb four times. But that seems not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump around right\" means to turn right four times (i.e., full circle) while performing the jump each time. But how many jumps?\n\nThis is a problem. However, given that the example must be followed, even if the rule seems conflicting. So perhaps for \"around <DIR>\", the agent must perform four turns, each followed by the verb, except the last turn. So the total number of actions would be 4 turns and 3 verbs. But that doesn't make sense. Let me try to see.\n\nWait, in the example input \"jump around right\", the output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP \n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP \n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP \n\nI_TURN_RIGHT \n\nSo the total of four turns and three jumps.\n\nWhich would be equivalent to [turn right, jump] three times, followed", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 65, "model_reflection": "Upon reviewing the initial response, the parsing of 'run left twice' was interpreted as 'I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT', which incorrectly applies the turn after the run each time.

The phrase \"after\" indicates that the order is reversed. So \"jump right after turn right twice\" means I should do \"turn right twice\" first, then do \"jump right\". \n\nWait, wait. Wait, the \"after\" rule says that \"A after B\" means do B then A. So in this case, \"jump right\" is A and \"turn right twice\" is B. So the order is B then A.\n\nSo first, process \"turn right twice\". According to rule 4, \"twice\" means repeat the verb sequence twice. The verb here is \"turn right\", so it's two turns right. That would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nThen, the \"jump right\" part. The verb is \"jump right\". But wait, \"jump right\" isn't a primitive verb. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump right\" is a jump followed by a turn right? Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, in the rules, \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\" as given. So \"jump\" is I_JUMP. But \"jump right\" here might be ambiguous. Wait, but the original example had \"jump around right\" which was parsed as turning right then jump, repeated four times. So in the example, \"jump around right\" becomes four times [turn right + jump]. Hmm. Wait, the original rules: Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns then the verb. Rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"jump around right\" is four times turning right and jumping. So \"jump right\" by itself isn't a primitive. Wait, but the input here is \"jump right after turn right twice\". So how to parse \"jump right\"? Is that a jump followed by a turn right? Or is \"jump right\" considered a direction?\n\nWait, according to the rules, the primitive verbs are only the ones listed. So \"walk\", \"run\", \"jump\", \"turn left\", \"turn right\". So \"jump right\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, perhaps the command is structured as \"jump (to the) right\", which would be equivalent to \"turn right then jump\"? Or maybe \"jump right\" is a direction modifier? But according to the rules, directions are handled in phrases like \"turn left/right\", \"opposite dir\", \"around dir\", etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the example: \"jump around right\" becomes the sequence of four turns right followed by jumps. So the \"around right\" part is a modifier on the jump. So maybe \"jump right\" is not a primitive. Wait, but the input in the example uses \"jump around right\" which is parsed as four times [turn right + jump]. So the \"jump right\" in the input of the current problem might be a similar structure. Wait, but the current input is \"jump right after turn right twice\". Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"jump in the right direction\", which according to rule 2 would be two turns in the direction (right) then the verb. Wait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then verb. So \"opposite left\" would be two left turns then verb. But \"jump right\" isn't \"opposite\", so perhaps \"jump right\" is not a rule. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is a mistake, and the user intended \"turn right then jump\", but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump right\" is a way to say \"turn right and jump\", but according to the existing rules, how would that fit? Let me see. The original rules don't mention that a verb followed by a direction (like jump right) would have a specific meaning. The only mentions of direction are in the \"opposite <dir>\" and \"around <dir>\" constructs. So perhaps \"jump right\" is simply a jump followed by a turn right? Or the other way around? Or is that a separate action?\n\nWait, the problem says \"jump right after turn right twice\". Let's parse this again. According to the rules:\n\nThe phrase \"A after B\" means do B then A. Here, \"A\" is \"jump right\", and \"B\" is \"turn right twice\". So first, we process \"turn right twice\", then \"jump right\".\n\nNow, processing \"turn right twice\". The verb is \"turn right\", and \"twice\" means repeat the verb twice. So \"turn right twice\" would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nNow, \"jump right\". Since \"jump\" is a primitive verb, but \"right\" here might be a direction. However, according to the rules, \"jump right\" isn't a primitive verb. So perhaps \"jump right\" is a mistake, or needs to be interpreted. Alternatively, perhaps the \"right\" is a direction modifier. Wait, looking at the rules again:\n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" → two turns in DIR then verb.\n\nRule 3: \"around <DIR>\" → 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb].\n\nRule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat verb sequence twice.\n\nSo, \"jump right\" doesn't fit into any of these. So maybe \"jump right\" is simply a jump followed by a turn right. But that would be a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"turn right then jump\", similar to \"around\" but not a defined rule. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the example input was \"jump around right\", which was parsed as four turns right and jumps. So \"around right\" is a modifier on the jump. Similarly, perhaps \"jump right\" would be parsed as a direction modifier, but there's no rule for that. The only rules with directions are opposite, around, and the turn left/right primitives.\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump right\" is a mistake, and the intended command is \"turn right and jump\", which would be \"turn right then jump\", but according to the rules, how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"turn right then jump\", similar to the \"opposite\" rule. But since the rule 2 is for \"opposite\", and rule 3 is for \"around\", maybe \"jump right\" isn't a standard command, and the user made a mistake. However, given that the user provided this input, I need to parse it according to the rules as best as possible.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe \"jump right\" is a verb followed by a direction, but there's no rule that applies here. Then, according to the rules, the only allowed verbs are the primitives. So \"jump\" is I_JUMP, and \"turn right\" is I_TURN_RIGHT. So maybe \"jump right\" is being used as a way to say \"jump and turn right\", but according to rule 5, \"A and B\" is A then B. So \"jump and turn right\" would be I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT. But \"jump right\" isn't \"and\", so that's not applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended \"jump\" as the verb and \"right\" as a direction, which isn't covered by the rules. In that case, the parsing might default to just \"jump\" followed by \"turn right\".\n\nSo, \"jump right\" would be I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT. But how?\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Wait, but in the example, \"jump around right\" was parsed as four repetitions of [turn right + jump], which comes from rule 3. So \"jump around right\" is four times (turn right then jump). So \"around right\" is a modifier on the verb jump. Therefore, \"jump right\" in the current problem may not be using any of the existing modifiers, so the right is not a modifier here, but perhaps part of another construct.\n\nWait, the original input is \"jump right after turn right twice\". Let's look at the structure:\n\nThe entire command is \"jump right after turn right twice\".\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nAccording to rule 6: \"A after B\" means B then A.\n\nSo A is \"jump right\", and B is \"turn right twice\".\n\nSo first, process B: \"turn right twice\". According to rule 4, \"twice\" means repeat the verb twice. The verb here is \"turn right\", so two times. So B becomes I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nThen process A: \"jump right\". Now, how to parse \"jump right\"?\n\nAssuming that \"jump right\" is a valid command. But according to the rules, \"jump\" is a primitive verb. There's no primitive verb for \"jump right\". So perhaps \"jump right\" is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the \"right\" here is a direction modifier, but there's no rule for that unless combined with \"opposite\" or \"around\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is a way to say \"turn right and jump\". But according to rule 5, \"and\" is used. So that's not applicable.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe \"jump right\" is a misphrasing, and the intended meaning is \"turn right then jump\", but according to the rules, how would that be expressed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"jump\" followed by \"turn right\". So \"jump\" as the verb, then \"turn right\" as another action. But according to the rules, unless there's a connector like \"and\" or \"after\", the parser might not handle that. However, the current command uses \"after\", so the input is \"jump", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 60, "model_reflection": "The original response misinterprets the structure of the command 'jump right after turn right twice'.

But wait, rule 4 mentions \"repeat the verb sequence twice\" for \"twice\", and similarly for \"thrice\". Wait, actually, looking back: rule 4 says \"A and B = do A then B in order\". Wait, no, rule 5 is about \"A and B\". Rule 4 says that \"twice\" and \"thrice\" are repetitions. So \"verb twice\" is repeat the verb twice. So \"jump thrice\" would be I_JUMP three times. So \"jump thrice\" is I_JUMP I_JUMP I_JUMP.\n\nThen \"jump right\". The verb here is \"jump\", and \"right\" is the direction. But how does direction apply to jump? Wait, the primitive verbs map to specific actions. The original rule 1 says that verbs like jump map directly to I_JUMP, regardless of direction? Wait, wait. Wait, looking at the rules again:\n\nRule 1: Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions: walk→I_WALK, run→I_RUN, jump→I_JUMP, turn left→I_TURN_LEFT, turn right→I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nWait, so \"jump\" is a primitive verb, which maps to I_JUMP. However, \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are also primitives. So if the command is \"jump right\", does that mean \"jump\" in the right direction? But according to the given examples, like \"jump around right\" becomes four repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So in that example, jumping around right involves turning right and jumping four times. So perhaps when a direction is added to a verb, it's interpreted as first turning in that direction then performing the verb. Wait, but in the example, \"jump around right\" is four times turning right and jumping each time. So \"around right\" is a special case where you turn right each time before jumping, four times.\n\nWait, the rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb].\n\nSo \"jump around right\" is parsed as four times: turn right, jump. So each repetition is first turning then jumping. So the direction applies to the verb. So if we have \"jump right\", how is that parsed?\n\nWait, \"jump right\" would not be a primitive verb, because according to rule 1, only \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitives that include direction. So \"jump right\" might be considered as a turn right followed by a jump, but wait, the user might be trying to use a directional jump. However, according to the given rules, only the turn verbs have directions. So perhaps \"jump right\" is ambiguous. Wait, but in the example, \"jump around right\" uses the \"around right\" which is a 4-repetition of [turn right + jump], so the \"jump\" here is a regular jump, but preceded by a turn right each time.\n\nWait, the problem is how to parse \"jump right\" when directions are only part of the turn verbs. Hmm. Let's check the rules again. The rules don't explicitly state that direction can be applied to other verbs. So perhaps \"jump right\" would be parsed as the verb \"jump\" while facing right, but according to the rules, that might translate to first turning right, then jumping. Wait, but the example given in the problem is \"jump around right\" which uses the rule 3. So maybe \"jump right\" would be \"turn right then jump\", but how is that covered by the rules?\n\nWait, but according to the rules, \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"opposite left\" would be two left turns, then the verb. So that suggests that sometimes the direction modifies the verb's execution. Maybe when a verb is followed by a direction, unless it's part of a compound phrase like \"around <DIR>\" or \"opposite <DIR>\", it's interpreted as a turn in that direction followed by the verb. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump right\" is not a standard command. The problem is that the rules don't specify how to handle a verb plus direction, unless it's in one of the defined patterns. The example given in the problem is \"jump around right\" which uses rule 3. So maybe \"jump right\" is parsed as a regular jump, and the \"right\" is redundant, or perhaps it's considered as a syntax error, but the system must parse it according to the given rules. Wait, but in the example, \"jump around right\" uses rule 3, so perhaps the presence of a direction after a verb can be considered as part of a compound phrase. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the problem's example input and output:\n\nInput: jump around right → Output: four turns right and jumps, ending with a final turn right.\n\nWait, the output is I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times, then another I_TURN_RIGHT?

No, wait, let's count.\n\nThe OUT is: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nEach repetition of [turn DIR + verb] is [turn right + jump]. Rule 3 says four repetitions. So each repetition would be turn right, jump. So four times:\n\nturn right, jump → turn right, jump → turn right, jump → turn right, jump.\n\nSo the total actions would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nBut the example's output ends with an additional I_TURN_RIGHT, making the count 4 turns and 4 jumps? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait the example output in the problem says:\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, this output has three I_JUMPs. But according to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Each repetition has one turn and one verb. So four repetitions would be four turns and four verbs. But the example output shows three I_JUMP and four I_TURN_RIGHT?\n\nWait the example's output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (then repeat) I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP, then I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP, then I_TURN_RIGHT (and then no jump?) Hmm, this is confusing. Wait the example given in the problem:\n\nInput: jump around right.\n\nThe output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWhich is 3 jumps and four turns. That would contradict the rule 3. Unless the example is wrong. Wait, perhaps the example is a typo, but according to the rule, around DIR is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb], which would be four turns and four verbs. So each of the four steps is turn, then verb.\n\nSo for \"jump around right\", the sequence would be:\n\nturn right, jump → turn right, jump → turn right, jump → turn right, jump.\n\nWhich would be four times each pair, leading to 4 I_TURN_RIGHT and four I_JUMP.\n\nBut according to the example output, the OUT is \"I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\", which is three I_JUMPs. That seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the example provided is incorrect. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the rule. Alternatively, perhaps the final turn right is part of the four repetitions, but in the example, the user may have miscalculated. Hmm. But regardless, I need to follow the rules as per the problem's instructions.\n\nAssuming that rule 3 is correct: around <DIR> = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb], so four times each. Then the example's output may have a mistake. But as per the problem's example, we need to follow the example's output. Alternatively, perhaps the example is correct. Let's check.\n\nProblem's example input: jump around right.\n\nThe output is written as:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nBetween the third I_JUMP and the last I_TURN_RIGHT, there's a space. So the output has four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP.

But \"left\" here is tricky. Wait, the primitive verbs include \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". So \"run left\" might be a direction? Wait, no. Wait, the rules say that \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. Hmm. Wait, the user might have meant \"run to the left\", but according to the given rules, maybe \"run left\" isn't directly a primitive. Wait, but looking at the example, in the example \"jump around right\" becomes a sequence starting with I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP etc. So perhaps \"run left\" would be a turn left followed by run? Wait, but the user wrote \"run left\", not \"turn left and run\". Wait, but according to the rules, maybe \"run left\" is not a primitive. Wait, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"run left\" is not a primitive verb. Therefore, perhaps \"run left\" is parsed as a direction? Hmm, but the rules don't mention directions for verbs. Wait, but the rules have \"opposite <DIR>\" and \"around <DIR>\", where DIR could be left or right. So maybe \"run left\" isn't a primitive. Wait, the user's command might have a mistake, but I need to parse it according to the given rules. Let me check the example again. The example input is \"jump around right\", which translates to turning right and jumping four times (since around is 4 repetitions of turn and jump). So in that case, \"jump\" is the verb, and \"around right\" modifies it. So perhaps \"run left\" here is intended to be \"run in the left direction\", but according to the given rules, maybe \"run\" is a primitive verb, and \"left\" here is part of a structure. Wait, but the first part of the command is \"run left and run opposite right thrice\". So \"run left\" could be a verb phrase. But according to rule 1, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"run left\" is not a primitive verb. Therefore, perhaps \"run left\" is parsed as \"run\" followed by \"left\"? But \"left\" isn't a verb. Wait, maybe \"run left\" is a mistake, but given that the user provided this command, I need to parse it. Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is equivalent to \"run\" in some direction. Wait, but the rules don't mention directions modifying movement verbs. So maybe \"run left\" is not a valid structure here. Wait, but the user wrote it, so perhaps there's a way to parse it. Wait, perhaps \"run left\" is a combination of a verb and a direction, but according to the rules, directions are used in \"opposite <DIR>\" and \"around <DIR>\". So perhaps \"run left\" is equivalent to \"run\" with a direction, but the rules don't specify that. Alternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a typo for \"turn left and run\". Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a compound verb. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, looking at the example: \"jump around right\" becomes the actions starting with I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP etc., which suggests that the jump is performed after turning. So maybe \"run left\" would be \"run\" modified by \"left\", but according to the rules, how can that be? Maybe \"run left\" is equivalent to \"run\" in the direction left, but the only way to handle that is if \"left\" is part of another structure. Wait, perhaps the initial \"run left\" is a mistake, but given that the user provided it, maybe I should parse it as \"run\" followed by \"turn left\", but that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe \"run left\" is supposed to be \"turn left then run\", but according to the rules, how would that be handled? The rules don't have a default for directions modifying verbs. Let me think again. The problem is that the command starts with \"run left and run opposite right thrice\". Let's split the command into parts. The main structure is \"run left\" and \"run opposite right thrice\", connected by \"and\", which according to rule 5 means \"do A then B in order\". So first process \"run left\", then process \"run opposite right thrice\".\n\nSo first, parse \"run left\". But according to the rules, \"run\" is a primitive verb. So what does \"left\" mean here? It could be that \"run left\" is a compound action. But according to the given rules, perhaps \"run left\" is not a primitive. Maybe \"run left\" is equivalent to \"turn left then run\", but the rules don't state that. Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a way to say \"run to the left\", but there's no rule for that. Alternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a typo, and the intended meaning is \"turn left and run\", but without explicit rules, I need to proceed. Wait, perhaps \"run left\" is parsed as \"run\" followed by \"left\" which is invalid. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, but the assistant must parse according to the rules. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe \"run left\" is a way to use the \"turn left\" action before the run. Wait, but according to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. Similarly, \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions. So perhaps \"run left\" could be a direction modifier, but the rules don't cover that. Alternatively, maybe \"run left\" is not a valid command here, but the user input is given, so I need to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a misphrasing for \"run around left\" or something else. Hmm. But given that the user provided this input, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that \"run left\" is \"run\" followed by \"turn left\" or vice versa. Wait, but the rules don't specify that. Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a compound verb, but since it's not in the primitive verbs, it's not recognized. Therefore, maybe the user intended \"run\" and \"left\" as separate, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a way to say \"turn left\", but that's not clear. This is a problem. Let me try to see if there's a way to parse \"run left\" according to the rules. The rules only map primitive verbs. So \"run\" is a primitive verb. \"left\" alone isn't a verb. So maybe \"run left\" is invalid. But the user input is given. Maybe \"run left\" is a typo for \"turn left and run\", but how can we parse it?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is parsed as \"run\" modified by \"left\" via some rule. For example, if \"run left\" is equivalent to \"turn left and run\", but the rules don't state that. The only direction modifiers are in the \"opposite\" and \"around\" constructs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended \"run left\" to be \"run to the left\", which in the environment would mean moving left, but according to the rules, the actions are only the primitives. So perhaps \"run left\" is not a valid command. However, the example uses \"jump around right\" which is valid. Since the user provided this input, perhaps there's a way to parse it. Maybe \"run left\" is parsed as \"run\" followed by \"turn left\"? No, that doesn't fit any rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a way to say \"run opposite left\", but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is an error, but the assistant should proceed as best as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended \"run left\" as \"turn left then run\", but how to justify that with the rules. The rules don't specify that. Let's think again. If \"run left\" is not covered by any rule, but \"run\" is a primitive verb, maybe \"run left\" is just \"run\" and ignore \"left\"? But that seems incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"run left\" is part of a different construct. For example, in the command \"run left and run opposite right thrice\", the \"run left\" could be \"run\" in the left direction, which requires turning left first. But according to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. But that's only for \"opposite\". So if \"run left\" isn't part of \"opposite\" or \"around\", then perhaps it's a separate action. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a typo for \"turn left and run\", which would be two separate actions. Then \"turn left I_RUN\". But according to the rules, \"turn left\" and \"run\" are separate primitives. If the user wrote \"run left\", perhaps the correct parsing is impossible, but maybe the assistant should proceed with the assumption that \"run left\" is \"run\" followed by \"left\" which is invalid. But this line of thought isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"left\" in \"run left\" refers to a direction modifier, which according to the rules, isn't directly covered.

However, under a more careful reading, 'run left' could be interpreted as 'turn left then run', especially if treating 'left' as implying a turn. This would align better with the structure of the language model's parsing rules.

The input is \"jump around left thrice after walk thrice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part according to the rules. The main structure here is \"A after B\", which according to rule 5 means doing B then A. So, \"jump around left thrice\" is A, and \"walk thrice\" is B. So the order should be walk thrice first, then jump around left thrice.\n\nStarting with \"walk thrice\". Rule 4 says \"thrice\" means repeat the verb sequence three times. The verb here is \"walk\", which maps to I_WALK. So \"walk thrice\" becomes I_WALK repeated three times: I_WALK I_WALK I_WALK.\n\nNext, \"jump around left thrice\". Let's parse \"around left\" first. Rule 3 states that \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb is \"jump\" (I_JUMP) and DIR is left. So \"around left\" would be four times turning left and jumping. Each repetition is I_TURN_LEFT followed by I_JUMP. So \"around left\" would be: I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP.\n\nNow, \"jump around left thrice\" means repeating that entire around left sequence three times. So each \"around left\" is four turns and jumps, and doing that three times. So each \"around left\" is a block of four steps, and we need three blocks. So that's three times the four-step sequence.\n\nPutting it all together, the full command is walk thrice (three I_WALKs) followed by three instances of the around left sequence. Each around left instance is four repetitions of turn left and jump. So the final sequence would be:\n\nWalk thrice: I_WALK I_WALK I_WALK.\n\nThen, jump around left thrice:\nFirst around left: I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (x4)\nSecond around left: I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (x4 again)\nThird around left: I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (x4 again)\n\nSo each around left is 4 steps, three times that would be 12 actions. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, each \"around left\" is four [turn left + jump], so each around left is 8 actions (each turn and jump is two actions). Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nRule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So for each repetition, you do turn left then jump. So four times: turn left, jump, turn left, jump, turn left, jump, turn left, jump. That's four pairs. So each around <dir> is 4 * 2 = 8 actions.\n\nThen, \"jump around left thrice\" means that the entire \"jump around left\" sequence is done three times. Wait, no. Wait, \"jump around left\" is the verb modified by around. So \"jump around left\" would be the verb \"jump\" with the around left modifier. Then \"thrice\" applies to that verb sequence. So \"jump around left thrice\" would be the \"jump around left\" sequence repeated three times. Wait, but according to rule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"jump around left\" is a single verb modified by around left. Wait, but maybe \"jump around left\" is parsed as \"around left\" modifying \"jump\", so the entire \"jump around left\" is equivalent to the example given where \"jump around right\" gives four turns and jumps. Then \"jump around left\" would be four repetitions of [turn left + jump], as per rule 3.\n\nBut then \"jump around left thrice\" would be repeating the \"jump around left\" sequence three times. Wait, rule 4 says \"verb twice\" is repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"jump around left\" is the verb (with modifiers) and \"thrice\" would mean repeat that entire action three times. So first, parse \"jump around left\" as per rule 3, which is four [turn left + jump], then \"thrice\" would multiply that by three. So the total for \"jump around left thrice\" would be three times the four [turn left + jump] sequences. Which would be 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 actions?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the \"jump around left\" is the action. When you say \"jump around left thrice\", that entire action is repeated thrice. So each time you do \"jump around left\", which itself is four [turn left + jump]. Then doing that three times.\n\nSo the \"jump around left thrice\" would be 3 * 4 repetitions of [turn left + jump]. Which would be 3 * 4 * 2 actions. But let me structure it properly.\n\nWait, in the example given:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nWhich is four times [turn right] followed by jump. Wait, no. The example output is each turn followed by a jump, four times. So four times (turn right then jump), so four pairs. Which is 8 actions total.\n\nSo \"around right\" applied to jump gives four (turn right + jump) pairs.\n\nSo \"jump around left\" would be four pairs of turn left and jump.\n\nThen \"jump around left thrice\" would be doing that entire sequence three times. So each \"jump around left\" is eight actions (four pairs), then multiplied by three. So 24 actions total.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFirst, walk thrice: I_WALK I_WALK I_WALK.\n\nThen, jump around left thrice: each \"jump around left\" is four pairs of I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP, so doing that three times.\n\nEach \"jump around left\" would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nThen repeat that three times. So each repetition of the around sequence.\n\nSo the entire output would be:\n\nI_WALK I_WALK I_WALK (from walk thrice)\n\nthen\n\n[ I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (x4) ] repeated three times.\n\nWhich would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\n(repeated three times, so three blocks of four pairs each)\n\nSo concatenating all of that:\n\nI_WALK I_WALK I_WALK\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP \n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP \n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP \n\nBut each of the three \"jump around left\" sequences would be four pairs. So the total number of actions would be 3*8 = 24 actions for the around part, plus 3 for the walk.\n\nSo the final output would be:\n\nI_WALK I_WALK I_WALK \n\nThen three times the around left sequence, each being eight actions. So:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP repeated three times.\n\nSo the entire output would be:\n\nI_WALK I_WALK I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP \n\nWait, but that's a bit hard to read. Let me count:\n\nEach around left: 4 pairs: 8 actions.\n\nThrice: 3 * 8 =24.\n\nSo after the walk thrice (3 actions), then 24 actions.\n\nTotal of 27 actions.\n\nYes. So the output is all the actions separated by spaces.\n\nSo the final answer should be:\n\nI_WALK I_WALK I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP repeated three times.

Let's split it into two main parts connected by \"and\": \"run around right\" and \"jump opposite left thrice\".\n\nStarting with \"run around right\". According to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" means 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb is \"run\" and the direction is \"right\". So each cycle is I_TURN_RIGHT followed by I_RUN. Since it's repeated four times, that part becomes four times that pair. So that would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN.\n\nNext part: \"jump opposite left thrice\". Let's parse \"opposite left\" first. Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. So opposite left means turning left twice, then jumping. So each \"opposite left\" is I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP. But then it says \"thrice\", which is three times. So we take the sequence for \"opposite left\" and repeat it three times. So that would be (I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP) three times in a row.\n\nNow, according to rule 5, \"A and B\" means do A then B. So first do the \"run around right\" part, then the \"jump opposite left thrice\" part.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFirst part: run around right → 4*(turn right + run)\nSecond part: jump opposite left thrice → 3*(opposite left jumps, each being two left turns and a jump)\n\nSo the entire sequence would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN repeated four times, followed by three instances of I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The \"opposite left\" is two turns left then the jump. So each \"jump opposite left\" would be two left turns then a jump. Then \"thrice\" means repeat that entire sequence three times. So yes, each time you do two left turns and a jump, three times total.\n\nSo combining both parts, the first part is four times (turn right + run), then the second part is three times (turn left twice + jump). All separated by spaces.\n\nI need to make sure there are no typos in the underscores and that all actions are uppercase. Also, check that the spacing is correct with spaces between each action. No commas or punctuation, just spaces. Let me write out the full sequence.\n\nFirst part:\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN\n\nSecond part:\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nPutting them together with a space in between:\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nWait, but between the two parts, is there a space? The example shows that the output uses spaces between all actions, no grouping. So each action is separated by a single space. So yes, the entire sequence is all the actions separated by spaces.\n\nLet me check if I missed any actions. The first part has four repetitions of turn right run. Each repetition is two actions. So 4*2 = 8 actions. Then the second part is three repetitions of two lefts and a jump. Each repetition is three actions, so 3*3=9 actions. Total of 8 +9=17 actions. Let me count the output.\n\nFirst part: 8 elements (each I_TURN_RIGHT and I_RUN four times, so 4 pairs). Wait, each pair is two actions. So four repetitions would be 4 times two actions, so 8 actions total. Then the second part: each \"opposite left\" is two lefts then jump (3 actions), repeated thrice, so 3*3=9 actions. So total of 8 +9=17 elements.\n\nLooking at the final output sequence:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nThat's 17 elements separated by spaces. Let's count:\n\nFirst part:\n\n1. I_TURN_RIGHT\n2. I_RUN\n3. I_TURN_RIGHT\n4. I_RUN\n5. I_TURN_RIGHT\n6. I_RUN\n7. I_TURN_RIGHT\n8. I_RUN → 8 elements\n\nSecond part:\n\n9. I_TURN_LEFT\n10.

According to rule 5, \"A and B\" means do A then B in order. So I need to handle each part separately and then combine them.\n\nStarting with \"jump left twice\". The verb here is \"jump\", but the \"left\" might be indicating a direction. Wait, the primitive verbs include \"jump\", but \"jump left\" isn't a primitive verb. Hmm, looking back at the rules, rule 1 says that primitive verbs like jump map to actions. But \"jump left\" isn't listed. Wait, maybe \"left\" here is part of the direction modifier. Wait, but the primitive verbs are specific. The primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump left\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, so the command might be \"jump (direction left)\" but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are fixed. Wait, perhaps \"jump\" is the verb, and \"left\" is a direction modifier. But according to the rules, how are direction modifiers handled?\n\nWait, looking at the example: \"jump around right\" becomes turning right and jumping four times. So \"around right\" modifies the jump. Similarly, \"opposite left\" would be two turns left then the verb. So direction modifiers like \"left\" or \"right\" can be used with verbs. Wait, but how about \"jump left\"? The problem is \"jump left\" isn't a primitive verb. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Wait, turn left and turn right are separate verbs. So \"jump\" is a verb, but \"jump left\" isn't. So perhaps \"jump left\" is equivalent to \"jump\" with a direction modifier? Wait, but the rules don't mention direction modifiers for verbs except in the cases of \"opposite\", \"around\", etc.\n\nWait, maybe \"jump left\" is not a valid primitive verb. Therefore, perhaps \"jump\" followed by \"left\"? Wait, but the original input is \"jump left twice and run left\". Let me parse \"jump left\" as a verb with a direction. Wait, but according to the given rules, how do we handle direction modifiers when the verb is not a turn? For example, if the command is \"walk left\", how would that be handled? The problem is the primitive verbs only include turn left and turn right. The other verbs (walk, run, jump) don't have direction variants. So maybe \"jump left\" is not a valid primitive verb, so the user's command might have a direction modifier that needs to be processed via turning first?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the rules. The first rule says that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. The list includes turn left→I_TURN_LEFT, turn right→I_TURN_RIGHT. So the other verbs (walk, run, jump) don't have directions attached. So \"jump left\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, perhaps \"jump left\" is interpreted as \"jump\" with a direction modifier, which would require turning first. But how? Wait, the \"opposite\" and \"around\" modifiers use turns. But in this case, the command is \"jump left\". Hmm. Maybe \"jump left\" is not a valid action. Wait, perhaps the user intended to turn left first and then jump. But according to the rules, how do we handle that?\n\nWait, the example given was \"jump around right\", which is handled by turning right and jumping four times. So \"around right\" modifies the jump, which is done after each turn. So in that case, the direction applies to the turning part of the modifier. So perhaps direction modifiers like \"left\" or \"right\" are part of the modifier, not the verb itself. Then, for a command like \"jump left\", how is it handled? Because there's no rule given for a simple direction modifier. Unless \"left\" here is a direction modifier that requires turning left before jumping. But how would that fit into the given rules?\n\nWait, maybe \"jump left\" isn't a primitive verb, so the user's command \"jump left\" should be parsed as \"turn left then jump\", but according to the rules, unless there's a modifier. Alternatively, maybe \"jump left\" is not a valid command here, and the correct way would be to have a turn left before jumping, but the user's command is ambiguous. However, given the problem, we need to parse the input according to the given rules. Let's look at the input again: \"jump left twice and run left\".\n\nWait, the second part is \"run left\". Similarly, \"run left\" isn't a primitive verb. So perhaps \"run left\" is equivalent to \"run\" after turning left. But how does that fit into the rules? The rules don't specify that verbs are direction-based unless you have a modifier like \"around\", \"opposite\", or \"twice\". So perhaps \"jump left\" is a mistake, but given the problem, maybe we are to interpret \"jump left\" as \"jump\" followed by a direction. Alternatively, maybe \"jump left\" is equivalent to \"turn left then jump\", but the rules don't specify that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" here is a typo and the intended meaning is \"turn left and jump\", but according to the rules, we can't make that assumption unless there's a rule to handle direction modifiers. Wait, but the example in the rules shows that \"around <DIR>\" is handled by turning in that direction and performing the verb four times. Similarly, \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in that direction then the verb. So, if a verb is modified by a direction, it's possible that the direction is part of some modifier. But in the case of \"jump left twice\", there's no such modifier like \"around\" or \"opposite\". So perhaps \"jump left\" is not a valid construct. But the user provided this input, so we need to parse it.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"left\" here is a direction for a turn. So \"jump left\" would be equivalent to \"turn left then jump\". Similarly, \"run left\" would be \"turn left then run\". But according to the rules, how would that be inferred?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump left twice\" is using the \"twice\" modifier. So \"jump left\" is a verb sequence that is repeated twice. But again, \"jump left\" isn't a primitive verb. Hmm. This is a bit confusing. Let's try to parse the input again.\n\nInput: \"jump left twice and run left\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nThe command is composed of two parts connected by \"and\". So part A is \"jump left twice\", part B is \"run left\". According to rule 5, do A then B.\n\nNow, part A: \"jump left twice\". The \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. So we need to parse \"jump left\" as a verb sequence, then repeat it twice.\n\nBut \"jump left\" would be \"jump\" followed by \"left\"? But \"left\" alone isn't a verb. Wait, unless \"jump left\" is being treated as \"jump\" with a direction modifier, which would require some turning. Alternatively, \"jump\" and \"left\" are separate verbs. But that would be \"jump then left\", but \"left\" isn't a verb. Wait, the primitive verbs are either walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump\" is a verb, \"turn left\" is a verb. So \"jump left\" could be parsed as \"jump\" followed by \"left\", but \"left\" alone isn't a verb. So that's invalid. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is a misstatement, and the intended meaning is \"turn left and jump\", but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake, but we need to parse according to the rules. Let's think differently. Let's consider \"jump left\" as a verb with a left direction, but since that's not a primitive verb, how to handle it. Wait, perhaps the \"left\" here refers to a direction modifier, but according to the rules, direction modifiers are handled via \"opposite\" and \"around\", and \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are their own verbs.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"left\" in \"jump left\" is a mistake and should be \"turn left then jump\", but how would that be indicated? Alternatively, maybe \"jump left\" is supposed to be \"jump\" in a direction that you're facing after turning left, but unless there's a modifier, that would require explicitly turning left first.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe \"jump left\" is a typo, and the intended phrase is \"turn left jump\". But according to the given problem, we need to parse \"jump left twice and run left\".\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump left\" here is equivalent to \"jump\" with a direction modifier, which would be handled as per the rules. Wait, but none of the rules apply to direction modifiers except \"opposite\" and \"around\". So perhaps \"jump left\" is not a valid command, but in this problem, we need to process it. Let's think of the possible way.\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump left\" should be considered as a single action, but since it's not a primitive verb, we can't. Therefore, the correct approach is to assume that the user made a mistake. But given that the problem includes this input, we have to parse it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump left\" is a mistake and should be \"turn", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 85, "model_reflection": "The original interpretation assumes that 'jump left' implies turning left before jumping, which aligns with the pattern seen in directional commands from the rules (e.g., 'around right' involves turning right before each action).

There is a slight ambiguity in how 'jump left' should be interpreted since the rules do not explicitly cover directional modifiers outside 'opposite' or 'around', but the chosen interpretation is logically consistent and adheres to likely intended semantics.

So I'll process each \"around left\" phrase separately and then combine them.\n\nStarting with \"walk around left\". Rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" means 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So for \"around left\", each repetition is a turn left followed by the verb. Since the verb here is walk, the sequence would be: turn left, walk, turn left, walk, turn left, walk, turn left, walk. Applying rule 1, those verbs become I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK repeated four times. So that's four times (I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK), which gives 8 actions total.\n\nThen similarly for \"run around left\". The verb is run, so each repetition is I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN, done four times. So another four pairs of I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN.\n\nNow, combining them with \"and\", which means doing the first then the second.

The input is \"walk around left and look opposite left thrice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part according to the rules. Let's start with \"walk around left\". According to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" means 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb is \"walk\" and the direction is \"left\". So, each repetition is turning left then walking. So that's 4 times: turn left, walk, turn left, walk, etc. So expanding that, it would be I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK repeated four times. So that part becomes I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK.\n\nNext part is \"look opposite left thrice\". Let's parse \"opposite left\" first. Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, the verb here is \"look\", but \"look\" isn't one of the primitive verbs listed. Wait, the rules mention primitive verbs mapping to uppercase actions, but \"look\" isn't in the list. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Hmm, but the example uses jump, which maps to I_JUMP. Wait, the user might be considering \"look\" as a verb here. But according to the rules, only the listed primitives are allowed. Maybe \"look\" is supposed to be a different action, but since it's not in the rules, perhaps there's a mistake. Wait, the problem says \"semantic parsing agent for navigation commands\" and the example uses jump. So maybe \"look\" isn't a valid primitive. Wait, but the input is given, so perhaps \"look\" is intended to be a valid verb. But according to the original rules, only the specified verbs are primitives. Wait, the problem states \"Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions: walk→I_WALK, run→I_RUN, jump→I_JUMP, turn left→I_TURN_LEFT, turn right→I_TURN_RIGHT.\" So \"look\" isn't in the list. Hmm, this might be a problem. But the input includes \"look\", so maybe it's a typo, or maybe \"look\" is supposed to be ignored? Or perhaps the user expects that \"look\" is a valid action. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" here is a mistake, but we need to process it. Since the problem includes this input, perhaps we should assume that \"look\" is a valid action, even though the original rules don't list it. Or maybe \"look\" is a verb that maps to a different action. Wait, but the rules don't mention any other verbs. So this is a problem. But given that the example works with \"jump\", maybe \"look\" here is supposed to be treated as a primitive verb. Let me proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a valid primitive verb that maps to I_LOOK, even though it's not in the initial list. Otherwise, the input would be invalid. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a mistake, but since the user provided it, we have to work with it. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, \"opposite left\" would be two turns in left direction (so two I_TURN_LEFT) then the verb. The verb here is \"look\". So \"opposite left\" would translate to I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK. Then \"thrice\" applies to the entire \"look opposite left\", so we need to repeat that sequence three times. Wait, the command is \"look opposite left thrice\". Let's parse that. According to rule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice; similarly for \"thrice\". So \"look opposite left thrice\" would be the sequence for \"look opposite left\" repeated three times. Wait, but \"look opposite left\" itself is a verb phrase. Let's parse \"look opposite left\". That is, the verb is \"look opposite left\", which is a combination. Wait, according to the rules, \"opposite <DIR>\" modifies the verb. So \"look opposite left\" would be parsed as: the main verb is \"look\", modified by \"opposite left\". According to rule 2, \"opposite left\" becomes two turns left then the verb. So \"look opposite left\" becomes two left turns followed by look. So that's I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK. Then \"thrice\" means repeat this entire sequence three times. So \"look opposite left thrice\" would be three repetitions of I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK. So the second part becomes [I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK] repeated three times: I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK.\n\nNow, the entire command is \"walk around left and look opposite left thrice\". Rule 5 says \"A and B\" = do A then B in order. So first do the \"walk around left\" part, then the \"look opposite left thrice\" part.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFirst part: walk around left → 4 repetitions of turn left + walk:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK.\n\nSecond part: look opposite left thrice → three repetitions of (turn left twice, look):\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK repeated three times: I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK.\n\nCombine both parts in order:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK.\n\nWait, but wait: the second part is \"look opposite left thrice\". The \"look opposite left\" is \"opposite left\" (two turns left) then verb \"look\". So yes, each instance is two turns left, then look. So each repetition is three actions. Thrice would be three times that. So the second part is three times [I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK].\n\nSo combining both parts:\n\nFirst part (walk around left):\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK.\n\nSecond part (look opposite left thrice):\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK repeated thrice → each thrice adds three copies. So three times two turns left and look.\n\nSo the total sequence would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK.\n\nI need to check if there are any other rules. Also, the example output for \"jump around right\" ends with I_TURN_RIGHT, since after four jumps, you have turned right four times. Each turn is part of each repetition. So in the example, each of the four steps is [turn right, jump], then the output is four pairs, then the final turn right. Wait, wait, looking at the example:\n\nIN: jump around right → OUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nWait, the example shows that each of the four repetitions adds a turn and the jump. But the output has four turns and four jumps, but the last action is a turn. Wait, according to rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is two actions: turn and verb. So four repetitions would be 4 turns and 4 verbs. But in the example, the output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated 4 times but the count is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (1st), then I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (2nd), then I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (3rd), then I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (4th), then finally I_TURN_RIGHT. Wait, no. Wait the example's output has 4 I_JUMPs and 4+1=5 I_TURN_RIGHT? Wait:\n\nIn the example:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nWait, the output sequence has:\n\nTurn, Jump, Turn, Jump, Turn, Jump, Turn, Jump, Turn.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let's count:\n\nThe output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1. Turn Right\n\n2. Jump\n\n3. Turn Right\n\n4. Jump\n\n5. Turn Right\n\n6. Jump\n\n7. Turn Right\n\nWait, that's 4 Turn Rights and 3 Jumps. But according to rule 3, around right should be 4 repetitions of [turn dir + verb], which would be 4 turns and 4 verbs. But in the example, there are 4 turns but 3 jumps? Or wait, no. Let me count:\n\nThe example output:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nSplit into:\n\nTurn Right, Jump, Turn Right, Jump, Turn Right, Jump, Turn Right.\n\nThat's 3 jumps and 4 turns. But according to rule 3, it should be 4 repetitions, which would be 4 jumps and 4 turns. But in the example, there's one more turn. So maybe the example is wrong? Or perhaps the rule is that after each repetition, you have a turn, and then the verb, but that doesn't align.

The input is \"turn opposite right thrice and walk\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the \"opposite right\" part. According to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" means two turns in DIR. So opposite right would be two turns to the right. Each turn right is I_TURN_RIGHT, so that's two of those: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nThen, the \"thrice\" applies to the previous action, which is turning opposite right. Rule 4 says \"twice\" repeats the verb twice, so \"thrice\" should repeat it three times. Wait, but rule 4 mentions \"around <DIR>\" which is 4 repetitions. Wait, no. Wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb], but rule 3 is for \"twice\" and \"thrice\". Rule 3 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So, \"turn opposite right thrice\" would mean repeating the \"opposite right\" three times. \n\nWait, so \"opposite right\" is two turns right, as per rule 2. Then \"thrice\" applies to that action. So \"turn opposite right thrice\" would be doing the opposite right three times. Each opposite right is two I_TURN_RIGHTs, so three times would be 2 * 3 = 6 turns. So that's I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT repeated three times: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nThen, the \"and walk\" part: rule 5 says \"A and B\" means do A then B. So after doing the three times opposite right turns, we do walk. Walk maps to I_WALK.\n\nPutting it all together: the first part is the thrice opposite right. Each opposite right is two turns right. So three times that would be 6 turns right. Then after that, walk. So the sequence should be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT repeated three times, then I_WALK.\n\nWait, but how to write that. Let's count:\n\nopposite right (once) = two turns right: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nthrice that action: repeat that twice more. So total three times. So each time is two turns right. So 2 * 3 = 6 turns right.\n\nSo the first part is six I_TURN_RIGHTs in groups of two each. Then walk.\n\nBut wait, \"turn opposite right thrice\" — the verb is \"turn opposite right\", which is the action. So \"thrice\" would repeat the entire \"opposite right\" three times. Which is each opposite right is two turns, so three times would be 6 turns.\n\nYes. So the first part is I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT three times: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nThen \"and walk\", so after that, add I_WALK.\n\nSo the entire sequence would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK", "rationality_label": "Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The original command 'turn opposite right thrice and walk' is parsed as follows: 'opposite right' means turning right twice (to end up facing the opposite direction), and doing this 'thrice' means repeating that sequence (two right turns) three times, totaling six right turns.

The input is \"walk around left twice after look opposite right twice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part according to the rules. Let's start with the innermost parts. The phrase \"look opposite right twice\" needs to be handled. According to rule 2, \"opposite right\" means two turns right followed by the verb. Wait, but \"look\" isn't a primitive verb listed in the rules. Hmm, the rules mention that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions, like walk, run, jump, etc. But \"look\" isn't one of them. Maybe there's a typo or maybe it's treated as a verb that's not mapped, but according to the given rules, perhaps \"look\" isn't a valid verb. Wait, the example uses \"jump around right\", so \"jump\" is valid. But the user input here has \"look\". Maybe it's a mistake, but according to the rules, I should consider only the listed verbs. Maybe \"look\" is ignored? Wait, no. The problem says \"semantic parsing agent for navigation commands\", so maybe \"look\" isn't a valid verb. Wait, but the user provided the input, so I have to process it. Wait, the rules specify that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions, but \"look\" isn't listed. So perhaps \"look\" is treated as a verb that doesn't correspond to any action? Or maybe it's a typo. But I need to follow the rules strictly.\n\nWait, looking at the example: the input was \"jump around right\" and the output included the jump actions. So maybe \"look\" would be treated as a primitive verb if it's in the input, but according to the given rules, the user hasn't provided a mapping for \"look\". But the user hasn't specified that. So perhaps \"look\" is invalid, but since the user provided it, maybe we should assume that it's a typo, but perhaps the system is supposed to handle it. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a valid verb that maps to some action. But according to the rules given, only the listed verbs are mapped. Wait, the rules under 1. list walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" is not a primitive verb. Therefore, how to handle that?\n\nThis is a problem. The input includes \"look opposite right twice\". But \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but as a parser, perhaps we should process it as per the rules. Wait, maybe \"look\" is considered a verb, but the mapping isn't provided. Hmm. The problem says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\", implying that any verb not listed isn't a primitive. Therefore, perhaps \"look\" is invalid. But the user's example doesn't have that, so maybe we should proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\"? Or maybe \"look\" is a valid action. Alternatively, perhaps the system allows other verbs but the user hasn't specified their mappings. But the problem says to use the given rules. Since the user hasn't provided a mapping for \"look\", perhaps we can't process it. However, the problem gives us the input, so we must parse it regardless. Maybe the answer will include \"I_LOOK\" even though it's not in the original rules. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the user intended \"look\" to be ignored, but that seems unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\" or another verb, but given that the input is as written, I have to proceed. Maybe the system allows other verbs, and the mapping is to uppercase with \"I_\", so \"look\" would be \"I_LOOK\". But since the example didn't mention that, perhaps that's the case. Let's proceed under that assumption, since otherwise the command can't be processed. So \"look\" would map to I_LOOK.\n\nBut given the rules, the assistant should only map the listed primitive verbs. Therefore, perhaps \"look\" is invalid, but the problem expects us to parse it as a verb and uppercase it. Let's proceed with that, converting \"look\" to I_LOOK.\n\nNow, starting with the input: \"walk around left twice after look opposite right twice\".\n\nBreaking this into parts. The main structure is \"A after B\", where A is \"walk around left twice\" and B is \"look opposite right twice\". According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means B then A.\n\nSo first process B: \"look opposite right twice\", then process A: \"walk around left twice\".\n\nLet's process B first: \"look opposite right twice\".\n\nBreaking down \"look opposite right twice\". The structure is \"opposite right\" then \"twice\". \n\n\"opposite right\" (rule 2) means two turns right then the verb. Wait, rule 2 says: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, wait, no: the verb is the original verb. Wait, the structure is \"opposite <DIR>\" applies to the verb. For example, if the verb is \"walk\", then \"opposite right walk\" would be two turns right then walk. But in this case, the phrase is \"look opposite right\", so the verb is \"look\". So \"look opposite right\" would be two turns right, then look. Then \"twice\" means repeat that entire sequence twice.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the structure here is \"look opposite right twice\". So the \"twice\" applies to the entire \"look opposite right\". Wait, but how to parse \"look opposite right twice\".\n\nBreaking down \"look opposite right twice\". Let's parse \"opposite right\" first. So according to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" modifies the verb. So \"look opposite right\" would mean two turns right, then look. Then \"twice\" would mean do that entire sequence twice.\n\nWait, but rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if the verb is modified by something, like \"opposite right\", then \"twice\" would repeat the entire modified verb sequence.\n\nSo processing \"look opposite right twice\" would be: the modified verb (opposite right look) done twice.\n\nBut wait, rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So for \"look opposite right\", we have two turns right (I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT), then the verb (I_LOOK). Then \"twice\" would repeat this sequence twice.\n\nSo \"look opposite right twice\" becomes: [I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK] repeated twice.\n\nSo the B part is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK\n\nThen moving to A: \"walk around left twice\".\n\n\"walk around left\" (rule 3) = 4 repetitions of [turn left + walk]. Then \"twice\" would repeat that entire sequence twice.\n\nWait, rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"walk around left\" would be:\n\n[I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK] repeated four times → I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK\n\nThen \"twice\" would repeat this entire sequence twice. But wait, \"around left\" is already a modified verb. So \"around left twice\" would be the \"around left\" done twice? Wait, the phrase is \"walk around left twice\".\n\nWait, the structure is: \"around left\" modifies \"walk\", then \"twice\" applies to that entire around action.\n\nBut rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"walk around left twice\" would mean the entire \"walk around left\" sequence is done twice. Wait, no. Wait, \"around left\" is a modifier on the verb \"walk\", making it a single action. Then \"twice\" would repeat that entire action twice. But \"walk around left\" as per rule 3 would be 4 repetitions of [turn left + walk]. So \"walk around left\" is a sequence of 4*(turn left and walk). Then \"twice\" would mean to do that entire sequence twice. So total of 8 steps (turn left, walk) repeated 8 times? Wait, no. Wait:\n\n\"walk around left\" → 4 repetitions of [turn left + walk], so the sequence is:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_WALK four times over.\n\nSo four times:\n\nturn left, walk → four times.\n\nSo total of 4 * 2 = 8 actions.\n\nThen \"twice\" would mean doing that entire \"walk around left\" twice. So the entire 8 actions again. So total of 16 actions.\n\nWait, but the \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. So \"around left\" is a modified verb. So \"walk around left twice\" is equivalent to \"walk around left\" done twice. Which would be 2 times the \"around left\" sequence. So each \"around left\" is four [turn left + walk], so doing it twice would be 8 [turn left + walk] sequences. So:\n\nEach \"around left\" is four times [turn left, walk], so twice would be 8 times. But according to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions. So \"walk around left\" is four [turn left + walk]. Then \"twice\" would be repeating that entire sequence twice. Wait, but the \"twice\" applies to the verb. So \"walk around left twice\" would be \"walk around left\" done twice.

The input is \"run twice after walk around right\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the structure. The main instruction is \"run twice after walk around right\". According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So here, A is \"run twice\" and B is \"walk around right\". Therefore, the overall sequence should be B followed by A.\n\nLet's parse B first: \"walk around right\". The \"around right\" part follows rule 3, which says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb is \"walk\", so each repetition is \"turn right then walk\". Since it's around right, we do this four times. So expanding \"walk around right\" gives us four instances of \"I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK\". Wait, but wait, rule 3 says each repetition is [turn DIR + verb], so each one is first the turn then the verb. So \"around right\" would be [turn right, walk] repeated four times. So that's four pairs of turn right and walk. So \"walk around right\" becomes four times \"turn right then walk\".\n\nThen, the \"run twice\" part is \"run\" repeated twice (rule 4). So \"run twice\" becomes \"I_RUN I_RUN\".\n\nPutting it all together according to \"A after B\" (B then A), we first do the \"walk around right\" which is four pairs of turn right and walk, then do run twice (two runs). Wait, but wait: the original command is \"run twice after walk around right\". So according to rule 6, \"run twice after walk around right\" is equivalent to \"walk around right\" followed by \"run twice\". So yes, the order is B then A.\n\nSo combining them, the full sequence should be the four repetitions of turn right and walk, followed by two runs. Let me make sure there are no other rules interfering here. Let me check each part again.\n\n\"walk around right\": around right is 4 times [turn right + walk]. So each cycle is turn right then walk. So each repetition is turn right, walk. So the first part of the sequence is I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK four times. Wait, no, wait. Wait, rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is turn DIR, then verb. So for \"walk around right\", the verb is walk, so each repetition is turn right then walk. So four times that. So the first part is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK (since four repetitions of [turn right + walk], each repetition being two actions). Then after that, we have \"run twice\", which is two I_RUNs.\n\nSo the entire sequence would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK repeated four times (so 4*2 actions), then I_RUN I_RUN.\n\nLet me count the number of actions. Each around right walk would be 4 turns and 4 walks, so 8 actions. Then run twice is two actions. So total 10 actions.\n\nWait, but in the example given, the output for \"jump around right\" is four pairs of turn right and jump, which is 8 actions. The example output is: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP four times the pair, but wait, no, looking at the example:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP ?\n\nWait, no. Wait the example says the output is \"I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\". Wait, wait, that's actually three full pairs and then an extra turn? No, wait, the example output as written is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times? Let me check.\n\nWait the example output given is:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, that's three I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP pairs and then a final I_TURN_RIGHT. Hmm, that seems inconsistent with the rule. Because according to rule 3, around is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each time, you turn, then do the verb. So four times. So for jump around right, each repetition is turn right + jump. So four times that. Which would be four turns and four jumps, alternating. So four turns and four jumps. So the output should be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP. Then, perhaps the example provided in the problem statement is wrong. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe example input is jump around right, output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, that's seven actions. Let's count:\n\n1. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\n2. I_JUMP\n\n3. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\n4. I_JUMP\n\n5. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\n6. I_JUMP\n\n7. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWhich is three jumps and four turns. Hmm, that's conflicting with the rule. Because according to rule 3, around should be four repetitions of [turn + verb], so each repetition starts with the turn. So four turns and four verbs. So four pairs. So 8 actions. But the example output here is seven actions. That's a problem.\n\nWait, this suggests that perhaps the example is a typo, or maybe the rule is different. Wait, looking at the example again. The output in the example is written as:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nNote the spacing here. Let me see: between each I_JUMP and the next I_TURN_RIGHT, but in the output, perhaps the user made a mistake. Let me count the number of actions here. Split the output:\n\n1. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\n2. I_JUMP \n\n3. I_TURN_RIGHT \n\n4. I_JUMP \n\n5. I_TURN_RIGHT \n\n6. I_JUMP \n\n7. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSo seven actions. But according to rule 3, each repetition is [turn DIR + verb]. So four times. Each repetition starts with a turn and includes a verb. So four verbs. But here, the output has three verbs. Which suggests that perhaps the example is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that \"around\" is four turns, each followed by the verb except the last one. Which would not make sense. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that \"around\" means turn, verb, turn, verb, turn, verb, turn. So four turns and three verbs? But that would be inconsistent with the rule description. The problem's example seems to have three I_JUMPs and four I_TURN_RIGHTs. Let's see:\n\nIn the example, the output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSo four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP. Which doesn't align with the rule as written. So perhaps the correct way is that \"around\" requires four turns (each in the direction) and four verbs. But according to the example, \"jump around right\" produces three jumps and four turns. Which suggests that maybe the rule is that around is \"turn, verb, turn, verb, turn, verb, turn\", which would be four turns and three verbs. But that contradicts rule 3 as written.\n\nThis is a problem. So according to the problem's rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So four times. So each repetition is a turn and a verb. So four times two actions each equals eight actions. So four turns and four verbs.\n\nBut the example output in the problem shows that \"jump around right\" gives four turns and three jumps. Which suggests that perhaps the rule is that around is three repetitions of [turn + verb], then a final turn. But that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is a typo. Let's proceed assuming that the rule is as described, not as per the example. Wait, but the example must be correct. Let me re-examine the example:\n\nProblem statement's example:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSo the output has three I_JUMPs and four I_TURN_RIGHTs. So each jump is after a turn right, except the last turn right isn't followed by a jump. That would suggest that the around rule is not four repetitions of [turn + verb], but three repetitions of [turn + verb], followed by a final turn. Hmm. But that would mean the rule is different. But according to the problem's rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So four times. So four turns and four verbs.\n\nBut in the example, there are three verbs and four turns. Which suggests that perhaps the actual rule is that the number of repetitions is equal to the number of verbs, and the number of turns is verbs +1. Which would conflict with the rule description.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is a typo. But since we have to follow the rules as given, not the example. Wait, the user says \"rules\" and the example. So perhaps the example is correct, and the rule description is slightly ambiguous. Let me re-examine the problem's rule 3.\n\nRule 3 says: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb].\n\nSo each repetition is a pair. So four pairs.

So \"jump and run left\" would be jumping first, then running left. Then \"twice\" means repeating the entire sequence twice. \n\nWait, but wait. The \"twice\" applies to the entire \"jump and run left\" sequence. So first, process the inner parts. Let's see:\n\n\"jump\" maps directly to I_JUMP. \"run left\" would be the action I_RUN followed by turning left? Wait no. Wait, the primitive verbs are mapped as per the first rule. Wait, \"run\" is I_RUN, and \"left\" as part of a direction. Wait, \"run left\" isn't a primitive verb. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, looking back at the rules.\n\nRule 1: Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So the verbs here are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"run left\" is not a primitive verb. Wait, no.

Wait, the rules say: \"Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions: walk→I_WALK, run→I_RUN, jump→I_JUMP, turn left→I_TURN_LEFT, turn right→I_TURN_RIGHT.\"\n\nAh, okay, so \"turn left\" is a primitive verb, which maps to I_TURN_LEFT. Similarly, \"run\" maps to I_RUN. So \"run left\" would be the action I_RUN followed by I_TURN_LEFT? No, wait. Wait, the user input may have \"run left\" as a command, but according to the rules, the only primitive verbs are those listed. So \"run left\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, that's a confusion. Wait, no. Let's re-examine.\n\nIn the rules, the primitive verbs are the ones listed. So \"run\" is a primitive verb, but \"run left\" would have to be parsed as a verb plus direction. Wait, but according to the rules, each verb must be one of the primitives. Therefore, \"run left\" would be two separate actions: first run (I_RUN), then turn left (I_TURN_LEFT). But wait, perhaps \"run left\" is meant to be a direction? Or is the left part part of the verb?\n\nWait, the problem is the input command. The user wrote \"jump and run left twice\". How to parse this?\n\nWait, the original example was \"jump around right\", which becomes four turns right and jumps. So the \"around right\" applies to the verb. So perhaps in \"run left\", the \"left\" is a direction modifier. Wait, but according to the rules, \"turn left\" is a primitive verb. Hmm. So perhaps \"run left\" is a compound command. Wait, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are the ones listed. So \"run\" is a primitive verb, and \"turn left\" is a primitive verb. Therefore, \"run left\" would have to be interpreted as two separate actions: run (I_RUN) followed by turn left (I_TURN_LEFT). But that might not be the case. Wait, perhaps the left is a direction modifier, but according to the input command, the way the user wrote \"run left\", we need to parse it.\n\nWait, the problem is that the user input is a natural language command. So \"run left\" could mean \"run in the left direction\", but according to the mapping, the only primitive verbs are the ones listed. So \"run left\" would be a verb (run) and then a direction (turn left)? Or is there a different way? Wait, the rules don't mention anything about moving in directions unless you use the turn commands. So maybe to run left, you need to turn left first, then run. Wait, but how does the agent face directions? Maybe each turn changes the direction faced. Hmm, but the problem here is just parsing the command into the action sequences.\n\nBut according to the rules, \"run\" is a primitive verb. So \"run left\" is not a primitive verb. So perhaps \"run left\" is not a valid command. But the user input is \"jump and run left twice\". Maybe that's a typo, or perhaps the user intended \"run left\" as \"run then turn left\", but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a mistake and should be \"turn left\", but given that the input is as is, we need to parse it.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a compound verb. But according to the rules, the primitive verbs are as listed, so \"run left\" is not a primitive. Therefore, maybe the correct approach is to parse \"run left\" as \"run\" followed by \"turn left\". But the problem is that the original command is \"run left\", which may not be a standard command. However, since the user provided this input, we need to parse it somehow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"left\" here is a direction modifier. But according to the rules, only \"opposite\" and \"around\" are direction modifiers. Wait, but the rules are about how modifiers affect verbs. So \"run left\" would be a verb followed by a direction modifier. But the rules don't cover that. So perhaps \"run left\" is invalid, but since the user gave it as input, we need to process it. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended \"run\" and \"turn left\" as separate verbs.\n\nWait, but according to the rules, \"A and B\" means A then B. So the original command is \"jump and run left twice\". Let's parse the structure. The entire command is \"jump and run left twice\". Breaking this down:\n\nFirst, \"jump and run left\" is the A and B, so do jump then run left. Then \"twice\" applies to that entire sequence, meaning repeat that sequence twice.\n\nBut then, how to parse \"run left\"? Since \"run\" is a primitive verb, but \"left\" is not a verb. So perhaps \"left\" here is a direction modifier. Wait, but according to the rules, direction modifiers are \"opposite\", \"around\", etc. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a mistake. But given that the user provided it, we need to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is equivalent to \"run then turn left\". So each verb in the command must be a primitive verb. So \"run\" and \"turn left\" would be two separate actions. Therefore, \"run left\" would be parsed as run (I_RUN) followed by turn left (I_TURN_LEFT). But in that case, the original command \"run left\" is a combination of a verb and a direction, which would require a rule that's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the left is a modifier to the run. But the rules don't cover that.\n\nBut given that the problem is to process this input, perhaps the intended way is to treat \"run left\" as the verb \"run\" followed by \"turn left\". Let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo the command is \"jump and run left twice\".\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n\"A and B\" → jump and (run left), so the sequence is jump followed by run left.\n\nThen \"twice\" applies to that sequence. So the entire sequence is [jump, run left], repeated twice.\n\nEach repetition of the sequence would be I_JUMP I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, \"run left\" would be run (I_RUN) and then turn left (I_TURN_LEFT)? Because each verb is a primitive. So each action is a primitive verb. So if \"run left\" is a command, but \"left\" isn't a primitive verb, perhaps the user intended to have a direction. So maybe \"run left\" is equivalent to \"run\" followed by \"turn left\", but that's not certain. Alternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a single verb, which it's not according to the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is invalid input. But since the user provided it, we need to find a way. Maybe the user intended \"run\" followed by \"turn left\", so two separate actions.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n\"jump and run left\" would be:\n\njump (I_JUMP), then run left (run (I_RUN) and turn left (I_TURN_LEFT)). Then \"twice\" means repeat this entire sequence twice.\n\nSo the full sequence would be:\n\nI_JUMP I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT repeated twice.\n\nWait, but \"jump and run left\" is A and B, so jump then run left. Then twice → repeat that entire sequence twice. So each iteration is [jump, run left], which is I_JUMP I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT, then again I_JUMP I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT.\n\nWait, but wait, \"run left\" would be two actions. So the entire sequence before \"twice\" would be I_JUMP followed by I_RUN and I_TURN_LEFT. Then, the \"twice\" would repeat that entire sequence twice.\n\nSo the total would be:\n\nFirst iteration: I_JUMP I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT\n\nSecond iteration: I_JUMP I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT\n\nCombined: I_JUMP I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT\n\nBut wait, according to rule 4: \"verb twice\" = repeat verb sequence twice", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 60, "model_reflection": "The phrase 'run left' likely indicates a single action, I_RUN followed by I_TURN_LEFT, and 'jump and run left twice' should be interpreted as repeating the entire sequence 'jump and run left' twice.

The input is \"jump around left thrice and jump opposite right twice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part. Let's start with \"jump around left thrice\". According to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" means 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb is \"jump\" and the direction is \"left\". So each repetition is turning left then jumping. Since it's \"around left\", that's 4 times. But wait, the user added \"thrice\", which means we should repeat the entire \"around left\" three times. Wait, no. Wait, the \"thrice\" applies to the verb sequence. Wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"jump around left\" would be the sequence [turn left, jump] repeated 4 times. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeat that entire \"around left\" sequence three times. Wait, but how does the \"thrice\" apply here? Wait, the original command is \"jump around left thrice\". The structure here is that \"around left\" is a modifier on the verb \"jump\", creating a new verb sequence, then \"thrice\" tells us to repeat that sequence three times.\n\nSo \"jump around left\" becomes [I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP] ×4. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeat that entire sequence three times. Wait, no. Wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"jump around left\" is the same as [I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP] ×4. Then \"thrice\" applies to this, so we repeat that whole block three times. But wait, the \"around\" is part of the verb modifier, so \"jump around left\" is the verb, and then \"thrice\" says to do that verb three times. So each \"around left\" is 4 steps, so doing that thrice would be 3× that 4-step sequence. So \"jump around left thrice\" would be [I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP] ×4 ×3. Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Let's clarify:\n\nThe structure of the command is:\n\n\"jump around left thrice\" AND \"jump opposite right twice\".\n\nFirst, \"jump around left thrice\". Let's parse each part.\n\n- \"jump around left\" is using rule 3 and 4. Wait, rule 3 is for \"opposite\", rule 4 for \"around\". So \"around left\" applied to \"jump\" means 4 repetitions of [turn left then jump]. So each time, you turn left, jump, repeat 4 times. So that's:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP.\n\nNow, \"thrice\" applies to this entire sequence. So \"jump around left\" is the verb, and \"thrice\" means we do that verb three times. So each \"around left\" sequence (which is 4×[turn left + jump]) is done three times. Therefore, the first part becomes:\n\n[ (I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP) ×4 ] ×3.\n\nThen, the second part is \"jump opposite right twice\". \n\n\"opposite right\" according to rule 2 means two turns in the DIR direction, then the verb. So opposite right would be two right turns, then jump. So \"jump opposite right\" translates to I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP.\n\nThen \"twice\" means repeat that twice. So the second part becomes [I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP] ×2.\n\nNow, the entire command is \"A and B\", which according to rule 5 means do A then B in order. So the first part (jump around left thrice) is A, and the second part (jump opposite right twice) is B. So we concatenate A followed by B.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFirst part: [ (I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP) ×4 ] ×3\n\nBreaking that down:\n\nEach around left is 4 times:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP repeated four times → each around left is 4 turns and jumps. Then thrice would repeat that four-step sequence three times.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, \"jump around left\" is the verb, so when you do it thrice, you do the entire \"around left\" sequence three times. So each \"around left\" is 4 repetitions. So doing it thrice would be three times the 4 repetitions, which is 12 repetitions. Let's see:\n\nOriginal \"jump around left\" is [turn left, jump] repeated 4 times. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeat that entire block three times.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst part:\n\n[ I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP ] repeated 4 times (for around left) and then that block repeated thrice.\n\nSo:\n\nFor one around left:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nMultiply that three times → total of 12 turns and jumps.\n\nSecond part:\n\n\"jump opposite right twice\".\n\nOpposite right is two right turns then jump. So each \"jump opposite right\" is I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP. Then \"twice\" means do that twice.\n\nSo the second part is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nPutting all together:\n\nFirst part (around left thrice):\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP ×4, then repeat that thrice.\n\nWait, but the structure here is that each \"around left\" is four times turn left and jump, then doing that three times. So the first part is:\n\n[ (I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP) ×4 ] ×3\n\nWhich would be written as:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\n(repeated three times)\n\nWhich would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nWait, no, because each around left is four times, and then thrice would repeat the around left three times. So each around left is four steps, so three around lefts would be 4 * 3 = 12 steps. So the first part has 12 steps (each being turn left and jump). Then the second part is two times opposite right, each opposite right being two turns right and a jump. So total:\n\nFirst part: 3 instances of 4 [turn left + jump] → 3 * 4 * 2 tokens (each action is two tokens), but in terms of the sequence:\n\nEach around left is four times [turn left, jump], so each around left gives 8 actions (but no, wait, each [turn left, jump] is two actions, and it's done four times. So each \"around left\" is 4 * 2 = 8 actions. Then doing that thrice would be 8 *3 =24 actions.\n\nSecond part: each opposite right is two right turns then jump. Then twice would be that done twice → each is 3 actions, so 3 *2 =6 actions.\n\nSo overall:\n\nFirst part:\n\n[ (I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP) repeated 4 times ] *3\n\nSo:\n\nFirst around left:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nSecond around left:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nThird around left:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nCombined, they are all concatenated.\n\nThen the second part:\n\nEach opposite right twice:\n\nFirst opposite right: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nSecond opposite right: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nCombined: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe entire output is:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP repeated 12 times (since 4 times per around left and thrice), then the opposite part.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, each around left is four times, so thrice would be three around lefts. Each around left is four [turn left, jump] steps. So each around left has four [turn and jump], so three around lefts would be 4 *3 = 12 [turn left, jump] pairs. But wait, no. Wait, no. The problem is how \"around left\" is four times [turn dir + jump], and \"thrice\" would mean that the entire \"jump around left\" is done three times. But according to the rules, \"around left\" is a modifier on the verb. Then \"jump around left\" would be the verb, then \"thrice\" would mean repeat that verb three times.\n\nBut how is \"jump around left\" a verb? So the original verb is \"jump\", modified by \"around left\", which creates a new verb sequence. Then \"thrice\" applies to that new verb. So each time you perform the modified verb once, it's the around sequence. So \"jump around left thrice\" means do this modified verb three times. Therefore, each \"jump around left\" is four repetitions of [turn left + jump], and doing that thrice would mean three times the four-repetition sequences. Which would be 4 *3 = 12 repetitions of [turn left + jump]?\n\nWait, no. No, wait.

Wait, looking at the example again. The input \"jump around right\" is parsed as four turns right and jumps. So the verb is \"jump\" and the around right adds the turns. Hmm. So in the problem, maybe directions modify the verb, but according to the rules, the only way directions are handled is through the \"opposite\", \"around\", and possibly the primitive verbs. Wait, the primitive verbs listed include \"turn left\" and \"turn right\", which map to I_TURN_LEFT and I_TURN_RIGHT. But \"jump right\" isn't a primitive verb. So perhaps \"jump right\" is not a valid command. Wait, but the input here is \"jump right and look right thrice\". So maybe the user made a mistake, but according to the rules, how to parse it?\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump right\" is a mistake, but according to the problem's context, maybe \"jump right\" is meant to be \"turn right then jump\", similar to how \"around right\" works. But the problem's rule 1 says that primitive verbs map to their actions. So the possible verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Wait, \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are verbs. So \"jump right\" is not a primitive verb. Therefore, \"jump right\" might not be a valid command. However, the user provided this input, so maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps the \"right\" in \"jump right\" refers to a direction, but according to the rules, the verb is \"jump\", and then \"right\" might be a direction modifier. Wait, but the rules don't mention direction modifiers except for the \"opposite\", \"around\", and \"turn left/right\". Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the command is structured as two parts: \"jump right\" (which might be a mistake) and \"look right thrice\". Wait, but \"look\" isn't a primitive verb listed. The primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" isn't a valid primitive. That complicates things. But the input is given as \"jump right and look right thrice\", which includes \"look right\", which might not be a valid action. But according to the problem statement, the agent is supposed to parse navigation commands, which might have actions like look. Wait, but the problem's rules only specify mappings for walk, run, jump, turn left/right. So maybe this input includes invalid verbs. But since the example uses \"jump around right\", which uses \"jump\", perhaps the agent is supposed to handle other verbs, but the rules only specify mappings for those primitives. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem assumes that any verb not listed is invalid, but the user input may have other verbs. Wait, the problem says \"semantic parsing agent for navigation commands\" and the rules specify how to map certain primitives. So if the input has a verb like \"look\", which isn't in the primitive list, how to handle it? But the example uses \"jump around right\", which is a valid verb. Maybe this is a typo in the problem's input. Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is intended to be a turn action. Wait, but according to rule 1, \"turn right\" maps to I_TURN_RIGHT. So \"look right\" isn't a primitive. Therefore, this input may have invalid commands. However, since the problem gives this input, we need to process it. Maybe \"look right\" is a mistake, but assuming that \"look right\" is intended to be \"turn right\", perhaps the user made a mistake, but the problem expects us to ignore non-primitive verbs. Alternatively, maybe \"look right\" is a typo for \"turn right\". But the problem states to process the input as given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is a compound command that's supposed to be parsed. But according to the rules, unless \"look\" is a primitive, it's not possible. Therefore, this input might have a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended \"look right\" to be \"turn right\", and \"jump right\" as a command. Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is a typo for \"run right\", which is a primitive. But without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to treat \"look right\" as \"turn right\", but that's an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the user intended \"look right\" to be a separate action not covered in the rules. But that's a problem. Let's try to proceed.\n\nAssuming that \"look right\" is a typo and should be \"turn right\", then the input would be \"jump right and turn right thrice\". But that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is supposed to be \"turn right and jump\", similar to the example where \"around right\" adds a turn each time.\n\nWait, considering the rules again. The \"around <DIR>\" is 4 times [turn DIR + verb]. So in the example, \"jump around right\" becomes 4 times (turn right, jump). So the verb is \"jump\", and the around adds the turns. Similarly, \"opposite left\" would be two turns left then the verb.\n\nBut how to parse \"jump right\"? Maybe \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"turn right then jump\", but only once. Because the primitive actions are turn left/right, and jump. So maybe \"jump right\" would be a single turn right followed by a jump. But according to the rules, unless there's a structure like \"around\" or \"opposite\", you can't combine turn and verb. So \"jump right\" might be invalid. But the problem's input has this, so perhaps the user intended that.\n\nWait, maybe \"jump right\" is a way to say \"turn right then jump\", similar to the \"around\" and \"opposite\" constructs. But the rules don't mention that. The rules only cover \"opposite\", \"around\", \"twice/thrice\", and \"and\"/\"after\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is a mistake and should be \"turn right and jump\". But the input is \"jump right and look right thrice\". So \"jump right\" and \"look right\" are both problematic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"jump right\" is parsed as I_JUMP followed by I_TURN_RIGHT, but that's not according to any rule. Alternatively, the \"right\" here is a direction modifier. Wait, but the rules don't specify that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that any direction after a verb implies turning in that direction before the verb. Like \"jump left\" would be turn left, then jump. But only when modifiers like \"opposite\" or \"around\" are not present. Wait, but the rules don't state that. Let me check the rules again.\n\nRule 1: Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So walk→I_WALK, etc. So \"jump\" is I_JUMP, \"turn left\" is I_TURN_LEFT, etc.\n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb.\n\nRule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb].\n\nRule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice.\n\nRule 5: \"A and B\" = do A then B.\n\nRule 6: \"A after B\" = do B then A.\n\nSo according to the rules, the only way to get a turn action is to use \"turn left/right\" as the verb. So \"jump right\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, \"jump right\" and \"look right\" are invalid. But given that this is the input, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the invalid parts or parse them somehow. But that's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump right\" is a mistake, and the intended input was \"turn right and jump\". But we can't assume that. Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is meant to be \"turn right\", given that \"turn right\" is a primitive verb. So maybe \"look right\" should be treated as \"turn right\", i.e., I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nAssuming that \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\", then \"look right thrice\" would be \"turn right\" thrice.

The input is \"jump opposite right and turn opposite left thrice\". I need to break this down into the correct sequence of actions based on the given rules.\n\nFirst, let's parse each part. The command has two main parts connected by \"and\": \"jump opposite right\" and \"turn opposite left thrice\". According to rule 5, \"A and B\" means do A then B in order. So I'll process each part separately and then combine them.\n\nStarting with \"jump opposite right\". The term \"opposite right\" refers to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" means two turns in DIR direction followed by the verb. Here, the verb is jump, and the direction is right. So applying rule 2: two turns right, then jump. That translates to I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_JUMP.\n\nNext part: \"turn opposite left thrice\". Let's break this down. First, \"opposite left\" according to rule 2: two turns left then the verb. The verb here is \"turn\", but wait, the phrase is \"turn opposite left\". Hmm, so \"turn opposite left\" would be the verb \"turn\" modified by \"opposite left\". Wait, but the primitive verbs include \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" as I_TURN_LEFT and I_TURN_RIGHT. But here, the structure is different. Wait, \"turn opposite left\" – maybe the verb here is \"turn\", and the direction is \"opposite left\". Wait, but according to rule 1, \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitives. So maybe \"turn opposite left\" would be a different case. Wait, no, the \"opposite\" applies to the direction. Let's think again.\n\nThe phrase \"turn opposite left\" would be parsed as follows: the direction is \"left\", and since it's \"opposite\", we apply two turns in left direction. Wait, no. Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, the structure is \"opposite <DIR>\" modifies the verb. So the verb here is \"turn\", but wait, that might not make sense. Wait, no. Wait, \"turn opposite left\" – perhaps the verb is \"turn\" and the direction is \"opposite left\"? Or is \"turn opposite left\" a verb phrase. Wait, original rules: the primitive verbs are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\", so \"turn opposite left\" is not a primitive. So we have to parse this.\n\nLet me re-express the second part: \"turn opposite left thrice\". The \"thrice\" applies to the verb sequence. So \"turn opposite left\" is the action to be done thrice. Let's parse \"turn opposite left\". The \"opposite left\" here would be a direction. Wait, no. Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" is a pattern. So \"opposite left\" is a direction modifier. Then, applying rule 2, \"opposite left\" would mean two turns in left direction, then the verb. Wait, but the verb here is \"turn\", right? Wait, the structure is \"turn opposite left\". So \"turn\" is the verb, and \"opposite left\" is the direction. But how does that fit with the rules?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"turn opposite left\" is equivalent to \"turn\" modified by \"opposite left\". But the original primitive verbs are only \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". So if we have to turn in a direction that's opposite left, which would be two left turns. Wait, but the \"opposite left\" would be the direction modifier. Wait, perhaps \"turn opposite left\" is equivalent to \"turn left twice\", but according to rule 2, \"opposite left\" is two turns in left direction followed by the verb. Wait, but the verb here is \"turn left\"? Hmm, this part is confusing. Let's re-examine the rule 2.\n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb.\n\nWait, the example given is \"opposite right\" would be two turns right then the verb. So in the first part of the command, \"jump opposite right\" is parsed as two right turns, then jump. Similarly, \"turn opposite left\" would be two left turns, then the verb \"turn\". Wait, but the verb here would be \"turn\", but that's not a primitive. Wait, no. Wait, the verb that is modified by \"opposite <DIR>\" is the verb that comes after. Wait, perhaps the structure is that \"opposite <DIR>\" precedes a verb. Wait, the phrasing in the rules says: \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. So the \"verb\" here is the verb that follows the \"opposite <DIR>\".\n\nWait, perhaps the syntax is \"opposite <DIR> <verb>\". For example, \"jump opposite right\" is the verb \"jump\" preceded by \"opposite right\", which indicates two turns right then jump. But in the second part of the command, it's \"turn opposite left thrice\". Wait, so the \"turn\" is the verb, and \"opposite left\" is modifying it. Therefore, \"turn opposite left\" would be parsed as \"opposite left\" followed by the verb \"turn\". Wait, but according to rule 2, \"opposite left\" would be two left turns, then the verb. So the verb here is \"turn\". Wait, but \"turn\" is not a primitive unless it's followed by left or right. So this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let's take the example given in the problem. The example input is \"jump around right\" and the output is 4 repetitions of [turn right + jump], which is 4 times I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP, then since around is 4 repetitions, that's 4 times that pair, leading to the output. So the rule for \"around\" is clear.\n\nNow, back to the current problem: \"turn opposite left thrice\".\n\nBreaking it down: \"turn opposite left\" is the action, and \"thrice\" applies to it. So \"turn opposite left\" is the sequence to be repeated three times.\n\nParsing \"turn opposite left\": The \"opposite left\" would be handled by rule 2. But the verb here is \"turn\". However, the primitive verbs are only \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". So \"turn\" alone isn't a primitive. Therefore, perhaps \"turn opposite left\" would be equivalent to \"turn left twice\" plus something? Wait, but according to rule 2, \"opposite left\" means two turns left, then the verb. So the verb here is \"turn\"? Wait, but \"turn\" needs a direction. So this seems problematic.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"turn opposite left\" is equivalent to turning in the opposite direction of left, which is right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"opposite left\" refers to the direction of the turn. For example, \"opposite left\" direction would be right. So if the command was \"turn opposite left\", that would be \"turn right\". But according to the problem's rules, the way to handle \"opposite <DIR>\" is as per rule 2: two turns in DIR then the verb. So that approach would be the correct way.\n\nWait, so in \"jump opposite right\", the verb is \"jump\", and the \"opposite right\" causes two right turns then a jump. Similarly, \"turn opposite left\" would be two left turns then a turn. But a \"turn\" requires a direction. So this seems conflicting.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem here is that the verb in this case is \"turn\", which itself requires a direction. So how to resolve that?\n\nWait, perhaps the command \"turn opposite left\" is a combination of \"turn\" and \"opposite left\". But according to the rules, the \"opposite left\" would be handled as two left turns, then the verb. Wait, but the verb here is \"turn\", but that doesn't make sense. Unless the \"turn\" here is a primitive that needs direction, which is not specified here. So perhaps there's an error here. Alternatively, maybe the \"turn opposite left\" is parsed differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"opposite left\" is a direction. So \"turn opposite left\" would mean \"turn in the opposite direction of left\", which is right. So \"turn right\". But according to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" maps to two turns in DIR, then the verb. So that would be two left turns, then the verb. Wait, but if the direction is left, then two left turns (which would result in facing opposite direction), then the verb. But the verb here would be \"turn\"? That doesn't fit. Unless the verb is \"turn\" in some direction.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let's try to approach it step by step.\n\nOriginal command part 2: \"turn opposite left thrice\".\n\nThe \"thrice\" applies to the verb sequence \"turn opposite left\", which would be repeated three times. So each time, we have to parse \"turn opposite left\".\n\nRule 2 says that \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR direction, then the verb. So in this case, the \"opposite left\" is modifying the verb \"turn\", but \"turn\" by itself isn't a valid primitive. However, the actual verb here must be one of the primitives. Wait, but the primitive verbs are \"walk\", \"run\", \"jump\", \"turn left\", \"turn right\". So \"turn\" isn't a primitive by itself. So perhaps \"turn opposite", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 65, "model_reflection": "Upon review, the interpretation of 'turn opposite left' was incorrectly expanded. According to the rules, 'opposite left' should result in two left turns followed by the verb. However, since the verb here is simply 'turn', which is not a complete primitive (primitives are 'turn left' and 'turn right'), the correct interpretation should be two left turns followed by a turn in the opposite direction—i.e., a 'turn right'. However, the repetition logic was applied correctly with 'thrice'. The combination of 'jump opposite right' was handled correctly.

Wait, the rules say primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. But if \"look\" is not a primitive verb, then how to handle? The problem statement says \"semantic parsing agent for navigation commands\" and rules apply to primitive verbs. Hmm. Maybe \"look\" is a verb not in the primitive set, so it's invalid. But the user expects us to process the command. Wait, perhaps \"look\" here is to be treated as a verb. But according to the given rules, only the listed verbs are primitives. The user might have made a mistake, but we have to proceed. Since \"look\" is not a primitive verb per the problem's rules, perhaps we should ignore it or assume it's a typo.

But that would leave \"look around left\" undefined. Hmm. This is a problem. Wait, but in the example, \"jump\" is used. So maybe the agent only recognizes the primitives listed, but the input includes \"look around left\". How to handle? Maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\"? Or perhaps \"look\" is a no-op. But that's unclear. However, the problem says \"process this command\" which includes \"look around left\", so perhaps \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\" or another primitive verb. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a mistake and the intended verb is \"walk\". But without clarification, perhaps we proceed with the assumption that \"look\" is treated as a valid verb. However, according to the problem's rules, only the listed verbs are primitives. Therefore, perhaps the command is invalid, but since the user provided it, maybe there's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is treated as a new primitive verb mapping to I_LOOK, but the rules don't mention that. This is a problem. However, given the example, maybe we should proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\". But perhaps the original problem intended \"look\" to be treated as a verb. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a no-op. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is equivalent to turning in place. But given that the rules don't specify, this is a problem. However, given that the user provided the command, perhaps we should proceed, treating \"look\" as a verb that maps to a no-op, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is treated as a turn, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps \"look around left\" would be treated as \"turn left around\", which would be the same as \"walk around left\". But without knowing the correct mapping, this is impossible. This is a critical issue. \n\nBut given that the user provided the input, perhaps we can assume that \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\". So \"look around left\" would be \"walk around left\", which would map to four repetitions of I_TURN_LEFT and I_WALK. But given that, proceed.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe command is: jump around left twice and look around left.\n\nBreaking into two parts:\n\n1. jump around left twice → according to rule 3 and 4.\n\n\"jump around left\" is four repetitions of turn left and jump. Then \"twice\" means repeat that entire sequence twice. So \"jump around left\" twice would be doing the four repetitions two times. So total eight turns left and eight jumps. Wait, no. Wait, rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. But in this case, \"jump around left\" is a compound verb. Then \"jump around left twice\" would be repeating the entire around left sequence twice. Wait, rule 4 says \"twice\" applies to the verb, but in this case, the verb is \"jump around left\", which itself is a compound. So \"jump around left twice\" would be doing the entire around left (four jumps) twice. So each around left is four jumps, and twice would make eight jumps. How?\n\nAlternatively, \"jump around left\" is four repetitions [turn left, jump] four times. Then \"twice\" would mean doing that entire around left sequence two times. So total four turns and four jumps per around left, multiplied by two. But the rule says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions. Then \"jump around left twice\" would be doing that entire around left (which is four jumps) two times. So total 8 jumps and 8 turns left? Or two times four repetitions.\n\nThen \"and\" implies doing both parts sequentially.\n\nAssuming \"look around left\" is treated as \"walk around left\", then \"around left\" would be four repetitions of turn left and walk → I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK repeated four times.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFirst part: jump around left twice.\n\njump around left → [turn left jump] four times.\n\ntwice → repeat that entire around left twice.\n\nWait, but rule 4 says \"jump around left twice\" is repeat the verb sequence twice. But \"jump around left\" is already a compound verb. So each \"around left\" is four jumps. So \"jump around left twice\" would be doing the around left twice. So each around left's sequence, then again the same. So sequence:\n\nturn left jump four times, then turn left jump four times again.\n\nBut according to rule 3, each around left is four repetitions of turn left + jump, so the entire around left sequence would be four turns left and four jumps. Then \"twice\" would repeat that entire block. So:\n\n[turn left jump] four times (jump around left), then [turn left jump] four times again (twice).\n\nThen \"and\" says do that, then do look around left. Assuming look is walk:\n\nlook around left → walk around left, which is four repetitions of turn left + walk.\n\nSo the entire output would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP repeated four times, then again I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP four times (total 8 turns and 8 jumps), followed by I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK four times (four turns and four walks).\n\nBut wait, according to the example's output structure, each around right ends with an extra turn. However, according to the rules, each around is four [turn + verb], which would be four turns and four verbs. However, the example's output for around right ends with an extra turn. Which suggests that each around has four turns and four verbs. But in the example output, there are five turns and four jumps. Hmm. Maybe the example is a mistake, but according to the rule, each around <DIR> is four repetitions of turn DIR + verb. So each rep is one turn and one verb. So four turns and four verbs. So for \"jump around right\", four times:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP four times. So sequence: turn, jump, turn, jump, turn, jump, turn, jump. So total eight tokens. But the example output has:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times, then another I_TURN_RIGHT. So nine tokens.\n\nBut according to the rule, it should be four times [turn + jump], which would be four turns and four jumps. But the example's output has five turns. So perhaps the rule is that after each verb, you turn again, but the initial direction requires a first turn, leading to four turns and four verbs. Or perhaps the example is a mistake. But since the example is given, perhaps the correct approach is to process around <DIR> as follows: for each repetition, turn DIR, then verb, and repeat four times. But then the example's output would have four verbs and four turns. However, the example output has five turns. So perhaps each around <DIR> is four turns followed by four verbs. No. Alternatively, the around <DIR> requires four turns in that direction, each followed by the verb, but each turn is a step in the around movement. So four times. So according to the example, \"jump around right\" → each turn right (90 degrees) then jump, four times. So four turns and four jumps. But the example output has five turns. Therefore, perhaps the example's output is a mistake, but regardless, the user's rules must be followed. \n\nAssuming that the example is correct and that around right involves four jumps and five turns. Which seems illogical, but perhaps the rule is that you turn first, then verb four times. Or perhaps each around involves turning four times and then doing the verb once. No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the around <DIR> is interpreted as follows: turn DIR, then perform the verb four times. No, that doesn't fit. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to follow the example. The example input 'jump around right' outputs a sequence of four I_JUMP and five I_TURN_RIGHT. Breaking down:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times and then an extra I_TURN_RIGHT. So total five I_TURN_RIGHT and four I_JUMP. This suggests that around <DIR> is four repetitions of the verb after turning DIR each time. So each repetition is a single turn DIR and then the verb, except that the final turn DIR is executed without the verb. Or perhaps the around <DIR> requires four turns with the verb and then a final turn. But this doesn't fit the rule. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct way to parse \"jump around left\" is to turn left four times and jump four times. But each turn is followed by a jump except the last one. Which would match the example. So around <DIR> is four turns DIR each followed by the verb, except the fourth turn is followed by no verb but just the final turn. No, the example's output has four jumps. So four jumps. So each turn is followed by a jump, except the last turn. So:\n\nturn right, jump (1)\n\nturn right, jump (2)\n\nturn right, jump (3)\n\nturn right, jump (4)\n\nturn right (final)\n\nWhich would be four jumps and five turns. So according to this, each around <DIR> is five turns and four verbs. Which doesn't align with rule 3. But example shows that. Therefore, the rule must be interpreted as:\n\naround <DIR> = four repetitions of [turn DIR then verb], then an additional turn DIR. Or perhaps the rule is implemented as four repetitions of [verb after turning DIR], with each turn DIR being cumulative to face the next direction. But regardless, based on the example, around right involves four jumps and five turns. But this is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each around <DIR> requires four turns DIR (each 90 degrees) which completes a circle, and each turn is followed by the verb. So four turns and four verbs. The example's output may have a mistake. But in the absence of clarification, proceed with the rule as written.\n\nRule 3: around <DIR> = four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So four times:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nSo four turns left, four jumps.\n\nNow, the \"jump around left twice\" would mean repeating the entire around left twice. But according to rule 4, \"verb twice\" means repeat the verb sequence twice. Since \"jump around left\" is a compound verb, \"jump around left twice\" would mean executing that compound verb twice. So each around left sequence (four turns and four jumps) twice → total eight turns left, eight jumps.\n\nThen \"and\" means do the first part then do look around left. Assuming \"look around left\" is a verb, but not primitive. If \"look\" is invalid, then perhaps the output skips it. But assuming it's a typo for \"walk\", then:\n\nlook around left becomes walk around left, which is four repetitions of turn left and walk.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFirst compound part: jump around left twice:\n\nfour [turn left jump] blocks, then four again.\n\nSequence: [I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP] ×4 followed by [I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP] ×4 again.\n\nWait, no. Each around left is four repetitions. So one around left is four turns and jumps. Twice → repeat that entire around left twice. So:\n\naround left once: I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP four times.\n\naround left twice: same sequence again.\n\nSo overall: 8 I_TURN_LEFT and 8 I_JUMP.\n\nBut according to rule 4, \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if \"jump around left\" is the verb sequence, then doing it twice → execute \"jump around left\" two times. Which would be four plus four repetitions.\n\nSo each around left is four [turn + jump], so twice would be two around lefts. But that's the same as above.\n\nThen look around left (assuming look is walk): four [turn left walk].\n\nSo the entire output would be:\n\nFor jump around left twice:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP repeated four times (first around left), then I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP repeated four times again (second around left).\n\nThen for look (walk) around left: I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK repeated four times.\n\nBut according to the example's output structure, each around ends with an extra turn. If we follow that, each around left would have five turns and four verbs. But that complicates things. However, given the example's output, perhaps each around <DIR> has four verbs and five turns. So:\n\njump around right → five turns right and four jumps.\n\nSo each around right: four verbs and five turns. Which would mean that the around DIR is four verbs and four+1 turns. But why?\n\nIn that case, jump around left twice would be:\n\nFor each around left: four jumps and five turns left. But wait, the example's around right has four jumps and five turns → so five turns for four jumps → four turns to get to the fourth jump, then fifth. Not sure. \n\nBut to reconcile with example:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times and then an extra I_TURN_RIGHT. So:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nThis is five I_TURN_RIGHT and four I_JUMP. So the around right is five turns and four jumps. So each jump is preceded by a turn, and there's an extra turn at the end. So the four jumps are each preceded by a turn, but the first turn is the first action, then jump, then turn, jump, etc., ending with a final turn. So four jumps have four turns before them, and then a final turn. So total five turns.\n\nBut that would mean:\n\naround <DIR> = four [turn DIR, verb] followed by a final turn DIR. Which complicates the rule. But according to the example, that's what's happening.\n\nSo the rule would be: around <DIR> = four repetitions of [turn DIR then verb], then an additional turn DIR.\n\nBut that's not what the rule states. Rule 3 states it's four repetitions of [turn DIR then verb]. So the example's output contradicts the rule. This is a problem. However, as a student, I should proceed with the given example's output despite the inconsistency.\n\nAssuming that \"jump around right\" is four verb applications (jumps), each preceded by a turn right, and then a final turn right. So five turns and four jumps.\n\nSo each around left would be five turns and four jumps.\n\nSo processing:\n\njump around left → I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT (five turns, four jumps)\n\njump around left twice would mean doing this entire sequence twice. But rule 4 says \"verb twice\" repeats the verb's sequence twice. So \"jump around left\" is the verb, which itself contains a compound action. So \"jump around left twice\" would mean repeating that compound verb's sequence twice. So two times the five turns and four jumps.\n\nBut that would be:\n\nFor first around left: five turns, four jumps.\n\nSecond around left: five turns, four jumps.\n\nTotal of ten turns and eight jumps.\n\nBut then the second part \"and look around left\" would be similar. Assuming \"look\" maps to, say, \"I_LOOK\" which is not a primitive. If \"look\" is invalid, then we can't process it. However, the input contains this, so perhaps it's a typo. Assuming it's \"walk\", then:\n\nlook around left → walk around left: five turns left and four I_WALK.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nFor jump around left ×2:\n\n[I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT] repeated twice.\n\nThen look (walk) around left:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT\n\nSo concatenating all:\n\nFirst part twice:\n\nEach around left: 5 turns, 4 jumps. Twice: total 10 turns, 8 jumps.\n\nSecond part: 5 turns, 4 walks.\n\nBut the output would be:\n\nFor first around left twice:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT\n\nWait, no. Each around left is nine tokens (five turns and four jumps). Repeating it twice would be writing that sequence again. So:\n\nFirst around left:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT\n\nSecond around left:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT \n\nAnd then the look around left (assuming look=walk):\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT\n\nCombined:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT\n\nBut the user's input says \"jump around left twice and look around left\". According to rule 5, \"A and B\" means A then B. So the first part is \"jump around left twice\", then \"look around left\".\n\nBut this entire approach is based on the example's output, which has five turns and four jumps. However, given the original problem's rules and example, this seems to be the expected approach.\n\nHowever, the problem says that \"look\" is part of the input. Assuming that \"look\" is not a primitive verb, we can't process \"look around left\". But given that, perhaps the correct approach is to ignore it or treat it as an error. However, since the user provided it, perhaps \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\", and we proceed.\n\nFinal answer:\n\nCombining all steps:\n\njump around left → five turns left and four jumps (per example's output pattern)\n\ntwice: repeat that entire around twice.\n\nThen look (walk) around left.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst around left twice:\n\n[I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP repeated four times with an extra I_TURN_LEFT] × two times.\n\nWait, no. Each around left is one block of five turns and four jumps. So two around lefts would be that block twice. Then the look around.\n\nBut this leads to a long sequence.\n\nAlternatively, the final answer based on strict rule application ignoring the example's output:\n\nAround DIR is four [turn DIR verb].\n\nSo:\n\njump around left: I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP four times (total four turns and four jumps)\n\ntwice: repeat that entire around left twice. So ×2: total eight turns and eight jumps.\n\nlook around left: assuming \"look\" is invalid. But if we proceed regardless, four [turn left verb], verb being unknown. If we proceed with look as verb but no mapping, can't process. Assuming it's ignored. Or if the system ignores unknown verbs, outputting only turns. But that's speculation.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and assuming \"look\" is a mistake for \"walk\":\n\nlook around left → walk around left: four [turn left walk].\n\nSo:\n\njump around left (four I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP) twice:\n\nFour turns and jumps, then four more:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP \n\n(repeated twice, so total 8 turns and 8 jumps)\n\nThen walk around left: four [turn left walk]\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_WALK repeated four times.\n\nCombined:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK\n\nBut this approach ignores the example's extra turn. Given the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is:\n\nFor \"jump around left twice\":\n\nEach \"jump around left\" is four [turn left jump]s. Twice that → eight pairs.\n\nBut rule 3 says four repetitions, so each around is four pairs → ×2 makes 8.\n\nBut then the output would be:\n\n(I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP){8} \n\nBut no, rule 4 says \"jump around left twice\" is repeating the verb sequence twice → each around is four pairs, done twice.\n\nBut also, the \"and\" then appends look around left's four pairs. Assuming look is walk:\n\n(I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK){4}\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP repeated four times, again four times, then I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK repeated four times.\n\nBut that totals:\n\nJump around left twice: 4*2*2? No:\n\njump around left: four repetitions [turn jump] \n\njump around left twice: repeat that twice, so total 8 repetitions of [turn jump]\n\nSo each \"jump around left twice\" would be eight [turn jump], then \"look around left\" (walk) four [turn walk]\n\nSo:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP eight times, then I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK four times.\n\nBut then:\n\njump around left is four; twice makes eight. look around left (walk) is four.\n\nBut according to rule 5, \"A and B\" is A followed by B.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n(I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP){8} (I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK){4}\n\nBut the example's output for around right ends with an extra turn, which we're ignoring here.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the confusion, proceed with the strict rule interpretation:\n\njump around left: turn left jump ×4\n\njump around left twice: do that ×2\n\nlook around left: assuming \"look\" is invalid → ignored. But user might expect it to be processed.\n\nAssuming \"look\" is valid and maps to I_LOOK (but rules don't state that), can't. So final assumption: typo for walk.\n\nFinal output:\n\nFor jump around left ×2:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (jump around left)\n\nRepeat twice: no, \"jump around left twice\" means do around left once and repeat the verb (jump) sequence twice. No, rule 4 says verb twice repeats the verb sequence. But \"jump around left\" is a compound verb. So repeating it twice would do it two times. So the entire around left sequence two times. Each around is four [turn jump], so total 2×4 turns and jumps.\n\nSo:\n\n(I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP){4} (I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP){4} (I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK){4}\n\nCombined:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK\n\nBut this seems lengthy. Alternatively, if \"jump around left twice\" is the first part:\n\njump around left is four [turn jump]. \"twice\" means do it twice, consecutively.\n\nSo:\n\nturn left jump ×4, turn left jump ×4.\n\nThen look around left (walk):\n\nturn left walk ×4.\n\nSo output:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK\n\nBut this doesn't include any extra turns. Given all this, I'll proceed with this final answer.", "model_reasoning": "Okay, let's break down the command step by step. The input is \"jump around left twice and look around left\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part. Starting with \"jump around left twice\". According to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" means 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb is jump and the direction is left. So \"jump around left\" would be turning left and jumping four times. But then it says \"twice\", which according to rule 4 means repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, does \"twice\" apply to the entire \"jump around left\" or just the \"jump\"? Hmm. Let's see. The structure here is \"jump around left twice\". The \"twice\" probably applies to the entire \"jump around left\" action. Wait, but \"around left\" already involves four repetitions. So \"jump around left twice\" would mean doing that entire sequence twice? Wait, but the rule says for \"around <DIR>\" it's four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"jump around left\" is already four turns left plus jumps. Then adding \"twice\" would mean repeating that entire block twice. But according to rule 4, \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb], so the \"twice\" here would multiply that. Wait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nOriginal: jump around left → each around left is four times turn left and jump. So \"jump around left\" would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP repeated four times, but wait, the example in the rules shows that for \"jump around right\", the output is four turns right and four jumps. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nExample input: jump around right → output: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times? Wait, the output in the example is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP [turn again, jump again, etc.] four times? Wait, the output in the example is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP four times, but how many turns and jumps? Let's count. The example output is:\n\nTurn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right. Wait, wait. Wait, in the example, the output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT ?\n\nWait, no, the example given:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, that's four turns and four jumps? Let me count:\n\nEach turn and jump pair is one repetition. The example has four jumps. Let's see:\n\nTurn right, jump → first pair. Then turn right, jump again (second), etc. until four jumps. Then after four jumps, there's a final turn right. Wait, but the example output has four turns and four jumps? Or five turns? Let me count:\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn right, jump (1)\n\nTurn right, jump (2)\n\nTurn right, jump (3)\n\nTurn right, jump (4)\n\nTurn right (final)\n\nWait, that's five I_TURN_RIGHT and four I_JUMP. Hmm. But according to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is a turn followed by the verb (jump). So each rep is turn + jump. So four reps would be:\n\nturn left, jump → 4 times.\n\nSo each rep is turn + verb. So four reps would have four turns and four jumps. But in the example, after four jumps, there's an extra turn. Wait, maybe the example is a typo? Or maybe the rule is that after each rep, you turn again? Hmm. Let's check the example again.\n\nThe example input: jump around right.\n\nThe output is: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times, but in the output given, it's:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWhich is (I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP) four times, then an extra I_TURN_RIGHT. Wait, count them:\n\nTurns: 5, Jumps:4. Hmm. That seems odd. According to rule 3, it should be four repetitions. So each repetition is [turn DIR + verb], so each rep starts with a turn and then the verb. So four reps would have four turns and four verbs (jumps). But the example shows five turns and four jumps. Because each rep is a turn, then verb, and after four reps, you end up with four turns and four verbs, but the example adds an extra turn. Wait, maybe the example is wrong? Or maybe the rule is that each repetition is [turn, verb], but the total is four repetitions, leading to four turns and four verbs. Let me check the example again.\n\nThe user's example says:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, the output has five I_TURN_RIGHT and four I_JUMP. So how does that match?\n\nAh, perhaps the example is structured as follows: when you do \"around right\", you turn right four times and jump each time. Wait, but the way to do around is to turn right four times, each time followed by a jump. But after the last jump, you have to turn again? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps after each jump, you turn again. Wait, but the rule says 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb], so each repetition is turn then verb. So four repetitions would be:\n\nTurn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump. Then stop. But that would be four turns and four jumps. However, the example output has four turns and four jumps plus another turn. So maybe the example is incorrect? Or perhaps the rule is that the number of turns is four, but the number of verbs is four. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the example is written with a final turn that's not followed by a jump. But according to the rule, each repetition is both a turn and a verb. So in any case, perhaps the example is a typo. Let's just proceed with the rule as stated.\n\nRule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is a turn DIR followed by the verb. So four times. So for \"jump around left\", it would be:\n\nTurn left, jump, turn left, jump, turn left, jump, turn left, jump. So four I_TURN_LEFT and four I_JUMP, in alternating sequence. So the output would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nBut according to the example, \"jump around right\" ends with an extra turn. So perhaps the example is different. But maybe the example's output was a mistake. But regardless, I have to follow the rules, not the example's output. Hmm. Wait, no, the example's output is part of the problem description. Let me recheck.\n\nThe example says:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWhich is 5 I_TURN_RIGHT and 4 I_JUMP. So four jumps and five turns. How does that fit?\n\nAh, perhaps the example is structured as follows: the around direction requires four turns to make a full circle, so four turns of 90 degrees each (right or left). So each around action is four turns (each 90 degrees) plus performing the verb each time. However, the initial direction is before the first turn. Wait, but that's not matching. Wait, perhaps the way the agent works is that before doing the verb, you turn in the direction specified. So when you \"jump around right\", you start turning right (east?), then jump, then turn again right (south), jump, etc. But after four jumps, you have made four turns (total 360 degrees) and then end up facing the original direction. Wait, but how many turns are needed to go around four times? Maybe each turn is 90 degrees. So to make four turns around right, you have four 90-degree turns right, which brings you back to original direction. Each turn in the around action is followed by the verb. So each of the four steps in \"around right\" would be:\n\nTurn right 90 degrees, perform verb (jump). Then turn right 90 again, perform verb, etc. So four times. So four turns total. Then, the four jumps. So the total around right would be four turns and four jumps. But in the example output, there are five turns. Hmm. Maybe the initial direction requires a turn first, but then four jumps. Or maybe the example is wrong. But regardless, according to the rule, \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Each repetition is turn DIR then verb. So four repetitions would be four turns and four verbs. So the example's output would have four turns and four verbs. But in the example, the output has four verbs (four jumps), but five turns. So perhaps the example is correct. Wait, the example's output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times, then another I_TURN_RIGHT. Let's count:\n\n1. I_TURN_RIGHT, I_JUMP\n\n2.

The input is \"run around right and look right thrice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part according to the rules. Starting with \"run around right\". According to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" means 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb is \"run\" and the direction is \"right\". So that should translate to turning right and running four times. Each repetition would be I_TURN_RIGHT followed by I_RUN. Since there are four repetitions, that part would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN\n\nThen there's \"and look right thrice\".

Wait, in the first rule, primitive verbs include \"turn left\" and \"turn right\", which map to I_TURN_LEFT and I_TURN_RIGHT. So \"look right\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, but the input might have a mistake here. Wait, the example input was \"jump around right\" and the output used I_JUMP. But according to the problem statement, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look right\" isn't a primitive verb. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, but the user provided the input \"look right thrice\". So maybe \"look right\" is a verb here. Wait, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are those listed, and they map to specific uppercase actions. So unless \"look right\" is considered a primitive verb, which it's not listed in the rules, so perhaps this is an error. Wait, but the problem says that the user might give such a command, so perhaps \"look right\" is intended to be treated as an action. Or maybe \"look right\" is a primitive verb. Wait, the original problem statement says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions: walk→I_WALK, run→I_RUN, jump→I_JUMP, turn left→I_TURN_LEFT, turn right→I_TURN_RIGHT\". So \"look right\" isn't among them. Therefore, perhaps \"look right\" is a compound command. Wait, but how to handle that? The problem statement might have a typo or oversight, but given the input, we have to work with it. Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is intended to be parsed as turning right. Because \"look right\" could be equivalent to \"turn right\", but according to the rules, \"turn right\" is the primitive verb. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe \"look right\" is a typo and should be \"turn right\". But assuming that the user intended to use a primitive verb, perhaps \"look right\" should be treated as \"turn right\", which maps to I_TURN_RIGHT. Otherwise, we would have to ignore the verb or not. But since the problem gives the input as \"look right\", perhaps we can assume that the user made a mistake and it's supposed to be \"turn right\". Alternatively, maybe \"look right\" is a typo. But since the problem doesn't mention how to handle non-primitive verbs, but the example uses \"jump around right\", which uses the primitive verb 'jump'. So perhaps in the input \"look right\", the 'look' is a verb not in the list, but 'right' is part of the verb as in 'turn right'? Wait, but the input is \"look right thrice\" as a separate part. So \"look right\" is a verb followed by a direction, but that's not a primitive verb listed. Hmm. This is a problem. How to handle that? The original instruction says \"You are a semantic parsing agent for navigation commands.\" So perhaps the agent should only process the commands that are based on the primitive verbs. But the input given by the user is \"look right thrice\". Maybe the correct approach here is to ignore that part, but the problem expects us to handle it. Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" here is equivalent to \"turn right\", which is a primitive verb. So maybe \"look right\" maps to I_TURN_RIGHT. That's an assumption, but since the problem includes that input, perhaps that's intended. Let's proceed under that assumption. So \"look right\" would be I_TURN_RIGHT. Then \"look right thrice\" would be rule 4, which says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice; similarly for thrice. So \"look right thrice\" would mean repeat I_TURN_RIGHT three times. Wait, but rule 4 says \"repeat the verb sequence twice\". So if the verb is \"look right\", which is one action, then repeating it thrice would be three times. So the sequence would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT. Wait, but \"look right thrice\" would be the verb \"look right\" (I_TURN_RIGHT) repeated three times. So yes. So putting it all together:\n\nOriginal command: \"run around right and look right thrice\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nFirst part: \"run around right\" → as per rule 3, that's four times [turn right then run], so each repetition is I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN. Four times would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN\n\nSecond part: \"look right thrice\" → \"look right\" is treated as I_TURN_RIGHT, repeated thrice (three times) → I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nThen, the \"and\" between the two parts (rule 5: A and B = A then B) so the total sequence is the first part followed by the second part.\n\nSo combining all together:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN followed by I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, the second part is \"look right thrice\", which is the verb \"look right\" done thrice. If \"look right\" is considered a single verb, which according to the rules, it's not. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe \"look right\" is intended to be parsed as two separate actions: \"look\" (but not a primitive verb) and \"right\"? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is a mistake and should be \"turn right\", which is a primitive verb. If we proceed with that assumption, then \"look right\" is a typo and should be \"turn right\", which is a primitive verb. Alternatively, maybe the user intended \"look right\" to be a new action, but according to the rules, it's not. Since the problem gives the input, perhaps we have to proceed as per the rules, which would ignore \"look right\" as it's not a primitive verb. But that can't be right. The example uses \"jump around right\", which works because \"jump\" is a primitive verb. So maybe the problem expects that \"look right\" is a verb and direction, but according to the given mappings, only \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitive verbs. Therefore, perhaps \"look right\" is invalid. But the user provided it, so there must be an intended solution.\n\nWait, perhaps \"look right\" is a mistake, and it should be \"turn right\". Let's proceed with that assumption. Then \"look right thrice\" would be \"turn right thrice\", which is rule 4: thrice means repeat the verb thrice. So \"turn right\" thrrice would be I_TURN_RIGHT three times. Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is a verb that's not in the list, which would make the command invalid, but the problem expects us to process it. Maybe the correct approach is to treat \"look right\" as a verb that's not in the primitive list, but perhaps the agent should ignore it. However, since the example uses \"jump\" which is in the list, and the problem is to process according to the rules, perhaps \"look right\" is a typo and should be \"turn right\". Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is intended to be a different action, but according to the rules, it's not a primitive verb, so perhaps the agent doesn't know how to parse it. However, the problem expects us to output an answer, so maybe the correct approach is to parse \"look right\" as \"turn right\". Let's proceed with that.\n\nTherefore, \"look right thrice\" becomes \"turn right thrice\", which according to rule 4: \"repeat the verb thrice times\". So \"turn right\" is the verb, which is a primitive verb. Then \"turn right thrice\" would be three times I_TURN_RIGHT. So the second part is three I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFirst part: run around right → four times [turn right, run], so:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN\n\nSecond part: look right thrice → I_TURN_RIGHT thrice.\n\nCombined with \"and\", which is first part followed by second part:\n\n", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 60, "model_reflection": "The phrase 'run around right' should result in 4 repetitions of [I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN], which is correctly interpreted.

The input is \"turn around left thrice after run opposite left\". Hmm, first, I need to parse this according to the rules given.\n\nStarting with \"run opposite left\". According to rule 2, \"opposite left\" means two turns in left direction. So \"opposite left\" would be two I_TURN_LEFT actions. Then, the verb \"run\" comes after those two turns. So the sequence for this part would be I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN.\n\nNext, the main command is \"turn around left thrice\" which is supposed to be done after the previous part. Wait, no, wait. The structure is \"A after B\" which means do B then A. So the entire phrase is \"turn around left thrice\" (which is A) after \"run opposite left\" (which is B). So according to rule 6, we first do B then A.\n\nFirst, parse \"turn around left thrice\". Rule 3 says \"around left\" is 4 repetitions of [turn left + verb]. But the verb here is \"turn\". Wait, \"turn around left\" would be each step in the around is turn left and then the verb. Wait, wait, \"around left\" means each time you turn left and then do the verb. Wait, rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So if the verb is \"turn\", then each repetition would be \"turn left\" plus the verb. Wait, no. Wait, in the example given, \"jump around right\" becomes four jumps each after a turn right, except the first turn right starts the sequence. Wait, the example output is four turns and four jumps. So each repetition is a turn right followed by a jump, repeated four times. So for \"around left\" with a verb \"turn\", would it be [turn left + turn] repeated four times? But \"turn turn\" doesn't make sense. Maybe in this problem, \"turn\" as a verb would map to I_TURN. Wait, but the primitive verbs include \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" mapping to I_TURN_LEFT and I_TURN_RIGHT. So \"turn\" alone isn't a primitive verb. Hmm, but the input here is \"turn around left thrice\". So the verb here is \"turn around left\", which is the around part. Wait, \"turn around left\" is the verb phrase. Let's see: \"turn around left\" would be the verb \"turn\" with \"around left\" as the modifier. But according to rule 3, \"around left\" would modify the verb. So the verb is \"turn\", and \"around left\" means that each step in the around is a turn left followed by the verb. Wait, no. Wait, the \"around left\" applies to the verb. For example, if the verb is \"walk\", then \"walk around left\" would be four times: turn left and walk. But in this case, the verb is \"turn\". Wait, but \"turn\" is not a verb in the primitive list. Wait, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb. Hmm, but the input is \"turn around left thrice\". So maybe the verb here is \"turn left\" and \"turn right\", but how to parse \"turn around left\"?\n\nWait, perhaps \"turn around left\" is a bit confusing. Let's parse \"turn around left\". The verb is \"turn\", but according to the primitive verbs, \"turn left\" is a verb. But maybe the phrase \"turn around left\" is using \"around left\" as a modifier on \"turn\". But the problem is that \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb; the primitives are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" as separate verbs. Therefore, perhaps \"turn around left\" is invalid? But the input is given, so I need to parse it. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps the verb is \"around left\" but that doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps the command is \"turn around left\" as in the example \"jump around right\", which would be the verb \"jump\" modified by \"around right\". So similarly, \"turn around left\" would have the verb \"turn left\"? Wait, because \"turn left\" is a primitive verb. So perhaps the structure is that \"turn around left\" would be the verb \"turn left\" with the modifier \"around left\". Wait, but that seems redundant. Alternatively, perhaps \"turn around left\" is equivalent to \"turn left around left\", but that's not the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input is \"turn around left\", which is a command where the verb is \"turn left\", and \"around left\" is a modifier. Wait, but that's not clear. Let me think again. The problem says \"turn around left thrice\". Let's parse this: according to the rules, \"around left\" would apply to the verb. So the main verb here is \"turn\", but since \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb, perhaps this is a mistake. Wait, perhaps the original input is \"turn around left\" but the actual intended verb is \"turn left\", but the user phrased it as \"turn around left\" to mean something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"turn around left\" should be interpreted as \"turn left around left\". No, that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps \"turn around left\" is equivalent to \"turn left around left\", but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the input is \"turn around left\", which is a command where the verb is \"turn\" and the modifier is \"around left\". But since \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb, this might not be possible. Hmm. This suggests that the input might have an error, but since the input is given, I must find a way to parse it. Alternatively, maybe the verb here is \"turn left\", which is a primitive verb. So perhaps \"turn around left\" is \"around left\" modifying \"turn left\", but how?\n\nWait, let's re-examine the rules. Rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. The verb here is the primitive verb. So for example, if the command is \"walk around right\", the verb is \"walk\", so each time you turn right then walk. Similarly, if the command is \"turn left around right\", then the verb would be \"turn left\", so each repetition would be \"turn right then turn left\". Wait, that makes sense. So in this case, the input is \"turn around left\", which would be \"turn\" as the verb, but \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, this input might be invalid. However, given that the user provided the input, I must find a way to parse it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"turn\" here refers to \"turn left\" or \"turn right\"? But that seems unclear. Wait, perhaps the input is supposed to be \"turn left around left\", but the user wrote \"turn around left\". Alternatively, maybe there's a typo. But I need to work with the given input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"turn around left\" is parsed as \"around left\" modifying the verb \"turn\". Since \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb, this might not be possible. Therefore, perhaps the problem is designed to have a trick here. Let me re-examine the input:\n\nThe entire input is \"turn around left thrice after run opposite left\"\n\nSo according to rule 6, this is equivalent to doing \"run opposite left\" first, then \"turn around left thrice\".\n\nFirst, processing \"run opposite left\". Opposite left is two left turns, then run. So actions are I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_RUN.\n\nNext, \"turn around left thrice\". Let's parse this. The base verb is \"turn\", but that's not a primitive. However, the user might have made a mistake here, but according to the problem's rules, perhaps we should treat \"turn\" as a verb. But according to rule 1, the primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn\" alone isn't a verb. Therefore, this is a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the intended meaning is \"turn left\" or \"turn right\", but how?\n\nWait, perhaps \"turn around left\" refers to turning left and then doing something else. Alternatively, maybe \"turn around left\" should be treated as \"turn left\" with the \"around\" modifying it. Wait, but according to rule 3, \"around left\" would modify the verb. So if the verb is \"turn left\", then \"around left\" would mean repeating four times: turn left and then turn left. Hmm, that might make sense.\n\nWait, if the verb is \"turn left\", which maps to I_TURN_LEFT, then \"around left\" would mean four repetitions of [turn left + turn left]. Because each repetition is turn DIR (left) and then the verb (turn left). So each repetition would be two I_TURN_LEFTs. Then four times that. But \"around\" would mean four repetitions of [turn dir + verb]. So each time, turn left then turn left. So four times, each time two left turns. But that would result in 4 * 2 = 8 I_TURN_LEFT actions? Hmm. Wait, no. Wait, each repetition is [turn left + verb], and the verb is \"turn left\", so each repetition is two left turns. So four repetitions would be eight left turns. Then \"around left\" on \"turn left\" would be eight I_TURN_LEFTs.\n\nBut then \"thrice\" applies to \"turn around left\", which would be", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The parsing followed the rules consistently.

Since \"look left\" isn't a primitive, how should that be parsed? \n\nWait, perhaps the problem has a typo and \"look left\" should be \"turn left\". Let me check the original input again. The input is \"look left thrice and turn left thrice\". Hmm. If \"look left\" is not a valid primitive verb, then according to the rules, that part would not be parsed into any action. But that would mean that the first part of the command (\"look left thrice\") would not generate any action. But that seems odd.

Therefore, perhaps the correct action sequence would only process the second part \"turn left thrice\" repeated three times. But the problem says that the agent should process the command according to the rules. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended \"look left\" to be \"turn left\", and it's a mistake in the input.

But that seems odd, but according to the rules, it's the case.\n\nWait, but the example input was \"jump around right\" which is a valid primitive. So perhaps the user's input here is invalid. However, the problem says \"Now process this command\", so the agent must process it regardless. Maybe there's a mistake in the input. Alternatively, perhaps \"look left\" is intended to be \"turn left\". But according to the rules, the agent must follow the given mappings. Therefore, \"look left\" would not be mapped to any action, and thus the first part is ignored.\n\nBut that would result in only \"turn left thrice\" being processed. But the user input says \"look left thrice and turn left thrice\". If \"look left\" is not a primitive verb, then the first part \"look left thrice\" would not generate any actions. Then \"and\" indicates to do the first part then the second part, but the first part is invalid. However, the problem may expect that the agent should proceed regardless. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and \"look left\" is meant to be \"turn left\". But assuming that the input is correct, how to proceed?\n\nWait, perhaps \"look left\" is a compound command. But according to the given rules, there's no mention of \"look\" being a verb. So the agent must ignore \"look left\" as not a primitive verb. Therefore, the first part of the command \"look left thrice\" would not generate any actions. Then \"turn left thrice\" would be processed as three I_TURN_LEFT actions. Then the \"and\" would mean to do the first part (nothing) then the second part (three turns left). Therefore, the output would be \"I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT\". But that seems unlikely. However, according to the rules, only the primitive verbs are mapped. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is that \"look left\" is ignored, and only the \"turn left thrice\" part is processed. \n\nBut the user might not have intended that. Alternatively, perhaps \"look left\" is a typo for \"jump left\" or \"turn left\". Alternatively, maybe \"look left\" is equivalent to a turn left. But according to the rules, the agent must strictly follow the mappings. So unless \"look left\" is a primitive verb, which it's not, the agent can't parse it. \n\nBut the problem is presented as a test, so perhaps there's a mistake in the input. Alternatively, maybe \"look left\" is intended to be a typo for \"turn left\", so the intended answer would process both parts as \"turn left thrice\" and \"turn left thrice\", then combine them with \"and\", which would be the same as \"turn left six times\". But according to the rules:\n\nThe input \"look left thrice and turn left thrice\" would be parsed as:\n\nFirst part: \"look left thrice\" — invalid, no action.\n\nSecond part: \"turn left thrice\" → [I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT]\n\n\"A and B\" → do A then B. So if A is invalid (no action), then output B.\n\nTherefore, the output would be I_TURN_LEFT three times.\n\nBut the user might expect that \"look left\" is a mistake and should be \"turn left\". If that's the case, then the processing would be:\n\n\"look left thrice\" → \"turn left thrice\" → three I_TURN_LEFTs.\n\nThen \"turn left thrice\" → another three.\n\n\"A and B\" → first do A (turn left thrice), then B (turn left thrice). So total of six I_TURN_LEFTs.\n\nBut according to the strict rules, \"look left\" is not a primitive verb. So how to proceed?\n\nThis is a problem. The question might have a typo, but given that the user provided it, I need to find the best way to handle this. Alternatively, perhaps \"look left\" is a typo for \"walk left\", which would be a turn. Wait, \"walk left\" is not a primitive verb either. The primitives are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\", not moving directions. So \"walk left\" would be a turn left then walk, but according to the command structure, that's a different case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"look left\" is a typo for \"jump\", but that's not clear.\n\nIn the absence of any rule about handling invalid verbs, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that \"look left\" is a mistake and that the user intended \"turn left\". Otherwise, the problem is invalid. Since the user presented this as a valid input, perhaps there's a misinterpretation here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects that \"look left\" is equivalent to \"turn left\", even though it's not listed. But according to the problem's rules, the mapping is only for the given primitives.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look left\" is considered a verb that maps to I_TURN_LEFT. But that's a stretch. The rules don't say anything about synonyms.\n\nTherefore, strictly according to the rules,", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The original instruction 'look left thrice' is not composed of defined primitive verbs, which are the only actions the agent can execute for navigation.

The input is \"turn opposite right and jump opposite right thrice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part according to the rules. Starting with \"turn opposite right\". According to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" means two turns in DIR. So opposite right would be two turns to the right. Each turn right is I_TURN_RIGHT. So two of those would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT. But wait, the verb here is \"turn\", so the structure is \"turn opposite right\". So the opposite part applies to the direction. So \"turn opposite right\" would be two turns right, as per rule 2. So that's I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nNext part: \"jump opposite right thrice\". Let's parse this. \"opposite right\" again is two turns right. Then \"jump\" would be the action. But the structure here is \"jump opposite right\", so according to rule 2, the opposite right (two turns right) then the jump. So the sequence would be two turns right, then jump. But then there's \"thrice\", which means repeat the verb sequence three times. Wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions, but here it's \"thrice\" for \"jump opposite right\". Rule 4 isn't applicable here; instead, rule 4 is for \"around\", so \"thrice\" would apply to the verb sequence. Wait, rule 5 says \"A and B\" is A then B. The input is \"turn opposite right and jump opposite right thrice\". So first part is \"turn opposite right\", then \"jump opposite right thrice\".\n\nBreaking down \"jump opposite right thrice\": \"jump opposite right\" would be two turns right (from opposite right) then jump. Then \"thrice\" means repeat this sequence three times. So each time, you do two turns right and then jump, three times. Wait, no. Wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. But \"opposite\" is different. Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"jump opposite right\" would be two right turns then jump. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeating that entire sequence three times. So each iteration is two turns right, then a jump. So three times would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP followed by the same sequence two more times. So total of three times.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFirst part: turn opposite right → two right turns: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nSecond part: jump opposite right thrice. Each jump opposite right is two right turns then jump. And thrice means three times. So:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated three times.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Wait, \"jump opposite right\" is two turns right then jump. So each time you do that, then thrice. So the sequence is:\n\nFor each of the three times:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nBut doing that three times would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nBut wait, but that would be three times the sequence of two turns and a jump.\n\nBut then, combining both parts of the original command:\n\nThe first part is turn opposite right: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nThen the second part is jump opposite right thrice: which is three times [I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP]\n\nSo the entire sequence would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT (from first part)\n\nthen\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (from thrice repetition)\n\nBut wait, but wait, the first part is \"turn opposite right\", which is two turns right. Then \"jump opposite right thrice\" which is three times (two turns right + jump). So combining both parts (rule 5: \"A and B\" = A then B), so the entire sequence would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT \n\nthen \n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated three times.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nWait, but wait: the first part is two turns right, then the second part is three times (two turns right plus jump). So each jump opposite right in the second part requires two turns right then jump. But each of these jumps is a separate sequence.\n\nWait, but when you do the second part three times, each time you do two turns right and a jump. But after each jump, you would have turned two more times. Hmm, but that might be correct. Let's check.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a mistake in interpreting \"jump opposite right thrice\" as each jump involves two turns right and then jump, and this is done three times. But the command says \"jump opposite right thrice\", which according to the rules would be \"opposite right\" (two turns right then jump) done thrice? Or is \"jump opposite right\" the verb, and \"thrice\" applies to that entire verb?\n\nWait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" = four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb], which is different. For \"jump around right\", you would do four times [turn right + jump]. But here, \"opposite right\" is handled by rule 2. So \"jump opposite right\" is two turns right, then jump. Now, \"jump opposite right thrice\" would mean do that sequence three times. So each time, two turns right and then jump. So three times that sequence.\n\nBut then, in the entire command: \"turn opposite right and jump opposite right thrice\". The first part is \"turn opposite right\", which is two turns right. Then \"jump opposite right thrice\" (three times two turns and jump). So the entire sequence would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT \n\nthen \n\n[ I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP ] repeated three times.\n\nSo concatenated:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP \n\nBut wait, this would be:\n\nFirst two turns right (first part), then in the second part:\n\nFirst iteration: two right turns and jump, which would be positions 3-4-5, then next two right turns and jump (positions 6-7-8), then again two right turns and jump (positions 9-10-11). \n\nBut wait, each time you do two right turns and a jump, but after each jump, the next iteration would start again with two right turns. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, is there a possibility that \"jump opposite right thrice\" is parsed differently? Like, turn opposite right (two right turns) first, then jump, and repeat that entire action three times. Which would be same as above.\n\nSo each time, you do two right turns, then jump. Then repeat thrice. So each time, you turn two more times right, then jump.\n\nBut each repetition is two turns and a jump. So three times that would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated three times. But this would result in turning right twice each time, then jumping. So the total number of right turns would be 2 (first part) + 2*3 (second part) = 8 right turns. Which would be equivalent to turning left twice (since four right turns is a full circle), but according to the problem's rules, we don't need to optimize, just follow the rules.\n\nTherefore, the final sequence is:\n\nFirst part: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSecond part: [I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP] repeated thrice.\n\nSo concatenating both:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP \n\nBut wait, wait. The first part is \"turn opposite right\", which is two right turns. Then \"jump opposite right thrice\" is three times \"jump opposite right\", each of which is two right turns then jump. So the entire sequence would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT \n\nthen\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP \n\nthen \n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP \n\nthen \n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP \n\nWhich would make the entire sequence:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP \n\nWait, but the order is correct? Because \"A and B\" means A then B. So the first part is A, the second part is B. So yes.\n\nBut wait, the user input is \"turn opposite right and jump opposite right thrice\". So the \"thrice\" applies to the \"jump opposite right\" part.

Wait, but according to the rules, \"turn left\" maps to I_TURN_LEFT, but \"run left\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"run left\" might be a problem. Wait, the user might have meant \"run to the left\", but according to the rules, only the verbs listed are mapped. Hmm, but the input is \"run left\". The rules say that primitive verbs map as run→I_RUN. So maybe \"run left\" is not a standard command here. Wait, but the original example uses \"jump around right\" which uses \"jump\" as the verb. So perhaps \"run left\" is considered a verb phrase where \"run\" is the verb and \"left\" is a direction, but according to the rules, the only primitive verbs are the ones listed. Wait, the first rule says that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. The primitive verbs are: walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitive verbs. So \"run left\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, but the input is \"run left\". That might be a problem. Wait, the user input is \"turn around right after run left\". Let's look at the example again. In the example, \"jump around right\" is parsed as 4 repetitions of turn right and jump. So \"around right\" is handled as 4 times [turn right then jump]. So \"run left\" here might be a verb plus direction, but according to the rules, how to parse it?\n\nWait, the input is \"run left\". Since \"run\" is a primitive verb, but \"left\" is a direction. But according to the rules, \"turn left\" is a primitive verb. But \"run left\" isn't a primitive verb. Hmm, perhaps the user intended \"run to the left\", but in the given rules, how is that handled? Or maybe \"run left\" is a mistake and should be \"turn left then run\"? Or perhaps \"run left\" is considered as running in the left direction. But according to the given rules, the primitive verbs are the ones listed. So unless there's a rule that allows combining movement verbs with directions (like \"run left\"), which isn't covered in the original rules, we might need to handle it as \"run\" followed by \"left\" which might be invalid. Wait, but the problem statement's example includes \"run left\" as part of the input. Let me check the original rules again.\n\nWait, looking at the rules again:\n\nRule 1: Primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn left\" is a single primitive verb. So \"run left\" is not a primitive verb. Therefore, \"run left\" would be invalid. Wait, but the user input has \"run left\". So perhaps that's a problem. Or maybe the user made a mistake. Wait, the input is \"turn around right after run left\". So the input is \"run left\" as part of the command. How to parse that?\n\nWait, maybe \"run left\" is a mistake and should be \"run and left\", but as per the given input, it's written as \"run left\". Alternatively, perhaps the user intended \"run\" followed by \"left\" as separate actions, but according to the rules, \"run\" is a verb, and \"left\" by itself isn't a verb. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a way to say \"turn left\" and \"run\", but that's not clear. Wait, perhaps the original input is \"run left\" as a direction, but according to the rules, that's not a primitive verb. But the user provided this input, so maybe we have to work with it. Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo, but the assistant should handle it as per the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to parse \"run left\" as \"run\" as the verb and \"left\" as a direction modifier. But according to the given rules, how does that work. For example, in the example \"jump around right\", the \"around right\" is a modifier for the jump. So perhaps \"run left\" would be a run in the left direction, but according to the rules, the only primitive verbs are those listed. Therefore, \"run\" is a primitive verb, and \"left\" by itself isn't. Unless \"run left\" is considered a compound verb, which isn't in the list. Therefore, maybe \"run left\" is invalid. However, the user provided this input, so perhaps we need to find a way to parse it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"run left\" is equivalent to \"run\" followed by \"turn left\", but that's not clear. Or perhaps \"run left\" is a mistake and the intended command was \"turn left and run\", but according to the given input, we need to process it as written.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to focus on the structure of the command. The main command is \"turn around right after run left\", which according to rule 6, \"A after B\" means B then A. So \"turn around right\" comes after \"run left\", so the order is run left, then turn around right.\n\nBut how to parse \"run left\". If \"run left\" isn't a valid primitive verb, perhaps the user intended \"run\" followed by \"turn left\", but that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a misphrase, and the correct command should be \"run then turn left\", but that's not stated. Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a direction modifier that doesn't affect the action (unlikely). Or perhaps \"left\" here is a noun, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"run left\" is parsed as \"run\" twice, but that's not applicable. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects that \"run left\" is treated as \"run\" as the verb, and \"left\" as a direction modifier, but according to the given rules, direction modifiers are used in constructs like \"around <dir>\", \"opposite <dir>\", etc. So maybe \"run left\" is an error. However, given that the user provided this input, perhaps the intended parsing is \"run\" followed by \"turn left\", but that's not clear.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that \"run left\" is a mistake and that the user intended \"run\" and then \"turn left\", but according to the rules, \"run\" is I_RUN and \"left\" is not a primitive verb. Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a way to refer to moving leftward, but the rules don't have a primitive for that, so we can't represent it. However, the example uses \"jump around right\", which uses a direction as part of the around construct. Therefore, perhaps \"run left\" is invalid. But the problem expects an answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"run left\" is a typo for \"turn left\", and the intended input is \"turn left\", which would make sense. Then \"run left\" would be parsed as I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe \"run left\" is parsed as run, with a direction left, but the direction is ignored. Or perhaps the system cannot handle that, but since the user gave this input, we have to make do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"run left\" is treated as \"run\" followed by \"left\", but \"left\" isn't a valid action, so the system would not process it. But the user expects us to generate a valid output. Hmm. This is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is intended to mean \"turn left\" and \"run\". But that's unclear. Wait, perhaps \"run left\" is a directional command that isn't a primitive verb, so it's invalid, but the user expects us to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the system should treat \"run left\" as \"run\" and ignore \"left\", but that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"left\" here is a direction for the run, but the system doesn't differentiate directions for walk/run/jump. In the example, the direction is only part of the turn/around/opposite constructs. So maybe \"run left\" is parsed as \"run\", ignoring the \"left\". But that's not according to the rules. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended \"run\" and \"turn left\", but wrote \"run left\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a missing rule here. For example, if a verb is followed by a direction, like \"run left\", it could mean that you turn in that direction and then perform the verb. But that's not specified in the rules. However, in the example for \"around <dir>\", it uses turn and verb. So maybe \"run left\" would be \"turn left then run\", but again, that's not specified in the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"run left\" is parsed as I_RUN and \"left\" is considered an error.

So maybe \"look\" here isn't a primitive, which suggests that perhaps \"look\" isn't a valid command. Wait, but the user provided this input, so maybe I need to consider that \"look\" might not be a primitive verb. Wait, the rules say \"primitive verbs\" map to uppercase actions. Are there other verbs that are allowed? The problem says \"semantic parsing agent for navigation commands\" so maybe \"look\" is not a primitive here. Wait, but how do I handle it then? Maybe this is a trick part of the problem. Wait, the example uses \"jump\", which is a primitive. So perhaps \"look\" is a verb that's not in the primitives. That would be a problem. But the input is given as such, so maybe I should proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a verb that's allowed in the system, but according to the rules, it's not a primitive. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the problem says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\" and lists walk, run, jump, turn left/right. So only those verbs. So \"look\" is a verb that's not a primitive, which would mean it's invalid. But since the user provided this input, maybe there's a mistake, but perhaps in this case, \"look\" is a typo and should be \"walk\"? Or maybe it's intentional. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a different kind of action that's not a primitive. But according to the rules, only those verbs are valid. Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting that \"look around left\" is parsed as turning left and doing something. But since \"look\" isn't a valid action, maybe this is a mistake. However, the example uses \"jump around right\" which works. So perhaps the user intended \"look\" here is a typo for \"walk\" or another valid verb, but since it's given as \"look\", I need to proceed. But according to the rules, \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. How should I handle this?\n\nWait, perhaps \"look\" is not a valid action, but the system should still parse it as per the rules. However, the output would have to use uppercase actions. Hmm, this seems conflicting. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a verb that's not in the primitives, which would make \"look around left\" invalid, but the user input is given, so perhaps we have to assume that \"look\" is a valid verb here. But according to the rules, the primitive verbs are only the ones listed. Therefore, this might be a trick question. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a typo and should be \"walk\", but I can't assume that. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a verb that can be used with the turn commands. Wait, but the output can only be composed of the uppercase actions listed. Therefore, \"look\" is not a valid action, but the user input includes it. This is confusing. Let's re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says \"semantic parsing agent for navigation commands\". The rules are given, and the example uses \"jump around right\". So maybe \"look\" is a typo, but according to the input, it's \"look around left\". If \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, then the action for \"look\" would not exist. However, the problem expects us to process it. Maybe \"look\" here is a mistake, but since the user presented it, perhaps we have to proceed. Wait, but the system must parse according to the rules, and if \"look\" isn't a primitive, then perhaps this is an invalid command. But the problem requires processing the given command. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is considered a verb here that maps to an action that's not listed. But according to the rules, only the specified verbs map to uppercase actions. Therefore, perhaps \"look around left\" would be invalid. However, the problem gives this input, so we have to work with it. Maybe the system allows other verbs, but the example only uses the given ones. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\" or another verb. But I can't change the input. \n\nAssuming that \"look\" is a valid verb, even though it's not listed in the primitives, but according to the rules, primitive verbs are the only ones that map. Wait, the first rule says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\". It's possible that other verbs exist but are not primitives, but how are they handled? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps \"look\" isn't a valid action here, making the entire input invalid. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a primitive verb, even though it's not listed. But the user's example uses \"jump\", which is in the list, so maybe \"look\" is not. \n\nThis seems like a problem. However, given that the example works, and the user provided this input, perhaps we have to proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a primitive verb. But according to the rules, it's not. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo. But given the input, we have to proceed as per the rules. Therefore, \"look\" would not have a corresponding uppercase action. So the command is invalid, but the user expects a solution. Therefore, maybe there's a mistake here, but perhaps \"look\" is supposed to be a typo for \"walk\". Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is intended to be ignored or handled in a certain way. However, without further information, I'm stuck here. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem assumes that \"look\" is a valid action. Let's proceed under that assumption, even if it's not listed in the primitives. Because the example uses \"jump around right\", which works because \"jump\" is a primitive. But in this input, \"look\" is not a primitive, which would make \"look around left\" not a valid command. But given that the user provided it, maybe this is a test of the system's ability to handle non-primitive verbs. In that case, the system should not process \"look\" because it's not a primitive. But then, how to output the actions? This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo and \"look\" should be \"walk\". Let's suppose that. Then \"walk around left\" would be processed as 4 repetitions of turn left and walk. But the original input is \"look around left\". Alternatively, maybe the verb is \"turn left\" in the \"around left\" part. Wait, no. The command is \"look around left\", which according to rule 3 would be four repetitions of [turn left + look]. But if \"look\" is not a primitive, then this is invalid. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer expects that we process \"look\" as a verb, even if it's not in the list. Let's proceed with that. So:\n\nFirst part: \"look around left\" → around left means 4 times [turn left + look]. So each cycle: turn left then look, repeated four times. So the actions would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK\n\nThen the second part: \"walk opposite right\". Opposite right means two turns in the given direction (right), then walk. So opposite right is two right turns, then walk. So the actions are: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK.\n\nBut according to the \"A after B\" rule, we have to do B then A. Here, the original command is \"walk opposite right after look around left\". So \"A after B\" is B then A. Here, \"A\" is \"walk opposite right\" and \"B\" is \"look around left\". Therefore, first do B (look around left), then A (walk opposite right). \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFirst part (look around left, repeated four times):\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK \n\nSecond part (walk opposite right):\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK\n\nSo the entire output would be the first part followed by the second part. \n\nBut wait, the example output uses underscores and spaces between actions. So the output should be all the actions separated by spaces. Also, check that each action is in uppercase with underscores. \n\nSo combining both parts:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK\n\nBut wait, the problem says to use only the uppercase actions. However, \"I_LOOK\" isn't in the list of primitives. According to the rules, primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left/right. So \"look\" would map to... nothing. Therefore, the action for \"look\" is invalid. \n\nThis is", "rationality_label": "Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The original command is 'walk opposite right after look around left'.

Wait, no. Wait, the verb is \"turn\", which isn't a primitive. Hmm.  \nWait, perhaps \"turn\" is a mistake, but according to the rules, the verb must be a primitive. So perhaps the command is \"turn left opposite left\" etc. But in the input, it's \"turn opposite right twice\". Let's try again.  \n\nWait, the verb here is \"turn\", but the primitives are turn left and turn right. So perhaps \"turn opposite right\" is invalid. But according to the problem statement, the agent must parse this. Therefore, perhaps \"turn opposite right\" is parsed as follows: the verb is \"turn right\" (since the opposite of a direction would be the other way). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps \"turn opposite right\" would be two turns right followed by the verb. The verb here would have to be one of the primitives. Wait, but the original command is \"turn opposite right twice\" → perhaps the verb is \"turn right\" or \"turn left\"?  \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"turn opposite right\" is parsed as \"turn left\", but the rules require strict application. Let's assume that \"turn opposite right\" means \"turn left\", but that's not per the rules.  \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the verb in \"turn opposite right\" is \"turn\", which isn't a primitive. Therefore, maybe the correct parsing is that \"turn opposite right\" is invalid, but given the problem, we must find a way.  \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the verb here is \"turn right\" (combining \"turn\" and \"opposite right\"). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding rule 2. Let's re-express rule 2:  \n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" → two turns in DIR then the verb.  \nSo \"walk opposite left\" → two left turns then walk.  \nSimilarly, \"turn right opposite left\" would be two left turns then turn right.  \nBut the primitives are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\".  \n\nSo, in the second part of the command: \"turn opposite right twice\"  \nThe verb here is \"turn right\" (since \"turn\" alone isn't primitive), but wait, the command is \"turn opposite right\". So the verb is \"turn\", modified by \"opposite right\". But according to rule 2, \"opposite right\" means two right turns, then the verb. But what's the verb?  \n\nAh, here's the key: The original verb is \"turn\", but in the primitive verbs, the only options are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". So perhaps \"turn opposite right\" is parsed as \"turn left\", but per the rules, we must follow the structure.  \n\nWait, perhaps the verb here is \"turn right\", so applying \"opposite right\" to it. No, this is getting too confusing. Let's proceed methodically.  \n\nFor \"turn opposite right\":  \n- According to rule 2, \"opposite right\" means two turns right, then the verb. The verb here would have to be a primitive verb. But the original command is \"turn opposite right\", which suggests that the verb is \"turn right\", but this is unclear. Alternatively, maybe the verb is \"turn\", which isn't valid.  \n\nBut the problem gives the input, so we must parse it. Let's assume that \"turn opposite right\" is parsed as follows:  \n- The verb is \"turn right\", but modified by \"opposite right\" → not sure.  \nAlternatively, perhaps the verb is \"turn\", which is invalid, but since the user input is given, we must proceed.  \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"turn opposite right\" is being used as a verb phrase. Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" → two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"turn opposite right\" would mean two right turns followed by the verb \"turn\". But \"turn\" isn't a primitive. So this is invalid.  \n\nWait, perhaps the verb here is \"turn right\", but the \"opposite right\" applies to it. Or maybe the command is \"turn opposite right\", where \"turn\" is part of the verb. Given the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that \"turn opposite right\" would be two right turns followed by the action of turning, which must be either left or right. But this is unclear.  \n\nLet me try to parse \"turn opposite right twice\" again:  \n- The entire phrase is \"turn opposite right twice\".  \n- \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence.  \n- The verb is \"turn\", modified by \"opposite right\".  \n\nBut given the rules, perhaps the correct parsing is:  \n- \"turn opposite right\" is parsed via rule 2: two turns right, then the verb. The verb here must be a primitive verb. But the original verb here is \"turn\", which isn't a primitive. This suggests an error, but the problem must be solved.  \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the verb is \"turn left\" or \"turn right\", and \"opposite\" applies. For example, \"turn opposite right\" means \"turn left\", but according to rule 2, it's two right turns then the verb.  \n\nLet's proceed with that.  \n\"turn opposite right\" → two right turns (I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT) then the verb. The verb must be a primitive verb. But the original command's verb is \"turn\", which is ambiguous.  \n\nWait, perhaps the original verb is \"turn right\", but modified by \"opposite right\". Not sure.  \n\nGiven time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that \"turn opposite right\" means two right turns followed by the verb. Since the original command's verb is \"turn\", but it's not a primitive, perhaps it's a mistake and should be \"turn right\" or \"turn left\". Alternatively, perhaps the verb is \"walk\" or something else.  \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the command is \"turn opposite right\", which would be parsed as two right turns and then a turn. But since turn isn't a primitive, this doesn't work.  \n\nGiven that the example uses \"jump around right\" which expands to turn and jump four times, I'll proceed under the assumption that \"turn opposite right\" is possible. Maybe here, the verb is \"turn left\" or \"turn right\".  \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"turn opposite right\" is not a valid command, but the user wrote it, so we have to parse it. Let's consider that \"turn opposite right\" would mean \"turn around\" (two turns, but not sure).  \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the verb is \"turn left\" or \"turn right\", and \"opposite\" applies. For example, \"turn opposite right\" would be equivalent to \"turn left\", but per rule 2, it's two right turns followed by the verb. So if the verb was \"turn left\", that would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_LEFT. But this is speculative.  \n\nBut the input is \"turn opposite right twice\". Let's assume that the verb here is \"turn right\", so \"turn opposite right\" would be two right turns followed by \"turn right\". Then:  \nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT.  \nThen \"twice\" would repeat this sequence twice. So two times:  \n[I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT] [I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT]  \n\nBut this may not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the verb is \"turn left\".  \n\nBut this is getting too stuck. Let's return to the original problem.  \n\nThe command is \"walk opposite left and turn opposite right twice\".  \nWe have to parse both parts.  \n\nFirst part: \"walk opposite left\" → I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK  \nSecond part: \"turn opposite right twice\".  \n   According to rule 4: \"verb twice\" = repeat verb sequence twice.  \n   So \"turn opposite right twice\" means do \"turn opposite right\" twice.  \n   Now, \"turn opposite right\": per rule 2, two turns right then verb.  \n   The verb here is \"turn\". But primitives are only turn left/right.  \n   Therefore, this must be a mistake. Perhaps the intended verb is \"turn right\"?  \n   If the original command was \"turn right opposite right\", then it would be two right turns and then turn right.  \n   But the input is \"turn opposite right twice\".  \n   So assuming that \"turn opposite right\" parses to two right turns and then a turn right, then:  \n   I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT  \n   Then \"twice\" → repeat this twice.  \n   So the second part is:  \n   I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT  \n\nBut this seems odd. Alternatively, if \"turn opposite right\" is two right turns and then turn left. But no basis.  \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the verb is implied to be the same as the turn direction. But not sure.  \n\nPutting it all together:  \nFirst part: I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK  \nSecond part: \"turn opposite right\" twice.  \n   turn opposite right → I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT (invalid verb)  \n   but if the verb is turn right:  \n   each \"turn opposite right\" is I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT  \n   twice: repeat this twice, so:  \n   I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT  \n\nBut since \"turn\" isn't a primitive, this can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps \"turn opposite right\" refers to turning left.  \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"turn opposite right\" is parsed as \"turn left\", but according to the rules.  \n\nGiven the confusion, and the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the initial part and make a best guess.  \n\nThe final answer would be:  \nFirst part: walk opposite left → I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK  \nSecond part: turn opposite right twice.  \n   turn opposite right → I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT  \n   twice → repeated twice: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT  \nCombined with \"and\" meaning do first then second:  \nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT  \n\nBut this feels wrong because \"turn\" isn't a primitive. Another possibility is that \"turn opposite right\" is invalid, but the problem requires an answer.  \n\nAlternative approach:  \n\"turn opposite right\" would be parsed as the verb \"turn right\", but modified by opposite. Rule 2: opposite right → two right turns then verb. The verb here is \"turn right\" → I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT  \nTwice → repeated twice.  \n\nSo combining all together:  \nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT  \n\nBut the output should be actions separated by spaces.  \n\nFinal answer:  \nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT  \n\nWait, but \"turn opposite right\" twice would be doing two times:  \n[I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT]  \nSo each \"turn opposite right\" is three actions, twice would be two times → 3*2=6. So the second part is 6 actions.  \n\nBut according to the rules, \"turn\" isn't a valid action. So perhaps the second part's verb is \"turn right\", then \"turn opposite right\" would be two right turns and then turn right, which is three I_TURN_RIGHT.  \n\nYes. So the final output is:  \n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT  \n\nBut wait, the second part is \"turn opposite right twice\":  \neach \"turn opposite right\" is two turns right and then turn right (3 actions), done twice: total 6 actions.  \n\nSo the final answer is:  \n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT  \n\nBut according to rule 4, \"verb twice\" repeats the verb sequence. So each \"turn opposite right\" is a verb sequence. So \"turn opposite right\" is a single verb sequence (3 actions), done twice: 6 actions total.  \n\nSo the output is correct.", "model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this command step by step. The input is \"walk opposite left and turn opposite right twice\". Hmm, I need to break this down into parts using the rules provided.\n\nFirst, let's split the command into two parts connected by \"and\". According to rule 5, \"A and B\" means do A then B in order. So the first part is \"walk opposite left\" and the second part is \"turn opposite right twice\". Let me handle each part separately.\n\nStarting with \"walk opposite left\". Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" means two turns in DIR then the verb. Here, the direction is left. So opposite left would be two turns left (I_TURN_LEFT twice) followed by the verb, which is walk (I_WALK). So that part translates to I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK.\n\nNow the second part: \"turn opposite right twice\". Wait, this might be a bit tricky. Let's parse it. The main verb here is \"turn\", modified by \"opposite right\" and then the \"twice\" applies to the whole thing. Wait, the structure is \"turn opposite right\" modified by \"twice\". Or is \"turn opposite right\" as per rule 2, then \"twice\" applies to that action. Let me check.\n\nRule 4 says \"A twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"turn opposite right twice\" would mean doing \"turn opposite right\" twice. But first, what's \"turn opposite right\"? Applying rule 2: opposite right is two turns right (I_TURN_RIGHT twice) then the verb. But the verb here is \"turn\" again? Wait, that might not make sense. Wait, \"turn opposite right\" would be the verb \"turn\" with the opposite direction. Wait, the original rule says \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no, rule 2 says that \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR direction followed by the verb. Wait, no: the example says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, the rule says: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So the verb here is \"turn\"? Or wait, no. Wait, the original rule 2 says that \"opposite <DIR>\" is equivalent to two turns in DIR direction and then the verb. Wait, no. Wait, the rule says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, the verb here is the one that's being modified by \"opposite\". For example, in the example \"jump around right\" the around modifies the jump. So if the command is \"turn opposite right\", then \"opposite right\" applies to the verb \"turn\". Wait, but how does that work? Let's clarify.\n\nWait, rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no, maybe the other way around. Wait, the rule says that \"opposite <DIR>\" is a modifier that means two turns in DIR direction followed by the verb. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps \"opposite <DIR>\" replaces the verb. For example, \"walk opposite left\" would be equivalent to two turns left, then walk. Because \"opposite left\" is modifying the walk direction. Hmm, but according to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, the way the rule is written: when you have \"opposite <DIR>\", you replace it with two turns in DIR followed by the verb. So the verb here is the original verb. So if the verb is \"walk\", then \"walk opposite left\" becomes two turns left then walk. So yes, that would be I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK. Which matches the first part.\n\nNow the second part: \"turn opposite right twice\". So first, parse \"turn opposite right\". The verb is \"turn\", and \"opposite right\" is modifying it. So according to rule 2, \"opposite right\" would mean two turns right followed by the verb. But the verb is \"turn\". So \"turn opposite right\" becomes I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN. Wait, but \"turn\" is the verb here. So the original action is \"turn\", but modified by \"opposite right\" to mean two right turns then a turn action. But wait, what's the turn action here? The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn\" by itself isn't a primitive verb. Wait, wait, looking at the rules again. Rule 1: Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions: walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitive verbs. So \"turn\" alone isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, in the command, any turn must be either \"turn left\" or \"turn right\". Wait, but the input in the second part is \"turn opposite right twice\". Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, the original command is \"walk opposite left and turn opposite right twice\". So the second part is \"turn opposite right twice\". Wait, the verb here is \"turn\", but according to rule 1, the primitive verbs are only walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So perhaps \"turn opposite right\" is a problem because \"turn\" alone isn't a primitive verb. Unless \"turn\" is part of the verb here. Wait, perhaps \"turn opposite right\" is parsed as a verb. Wait, this is a possible point of confusion. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the command is \"turn opposite right twice\". The structure here is \"turn\" followed by \"opposite right\", then \"twice\" applies to the whole thing. But according to the rules, the primitive verbs are the ones listed. So \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb unless it's \"turn left\" or \"turn right\". Therefore, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let's think: perhaps \"turn opposite right\" is parsed as a direction. Alternatively, perhaps the verb is \"turn\", which is not in the primitive list. That's a problem. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the agent is parsing navigation commands into the given primitives. So perhaps \"turn opposite right\" must be converted into the allowed primitives. Let's try to parse \"turn opposite right\". The rule 2 says that \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. So in this case, the verb here is \"turn\". Wait, but \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb. Hmm. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, the primitive verbs are turn left and turn right. So \"turn\" as a verb isn't allowed. Therefore, perhaps the original command's second part is \"turn opposite right twice\", which would have to be parsed into allowed primitives.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"turn opposite right\" is equivalent to \"turn left\"? But according to the rules. Let's approach this again.\n\nRule 2 says that \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, but how does that apply when the verb is \"turn left\" or \"turn right\"? Let's take an example. If the command was \"turn left opposite left\", then according to rule 2, that would be two turns left, then turn left. Which would be three left turns. But perhaps the rule's application depends on the verb.\n\nWait, perhaps \"turn opposite right\" would be parsed as follows: the verb is \"turn\", but since only \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitives, perhaps there's a mistake here. But according to the input command, the user has written \"turn opposite right twice\", so we have to parse it. Let's re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the key point: when \"opposite <DIR>\" is used, according to rule 2, the verb is the original verb. So \"turn opposite right\" would mean two turns right, then the verb. The verb here is \"turn\", but the primitive verbs are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". So perhaps \"turn\" here implies \"turn left or right\" based on the context. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps \"turn opposite right\" is a way to refer to a direction. Maybe the correct approach is to realize that \"turn opposite right\" would mean to turn in the opposite direction, which would be left. But according to the rules, we can't do that; we have to follow the rules strictly.\n\nLet me re-express the command \"turn opposite right twice\". Let's break it down. The main verb here is \"turn\", modified by \"opposite right\", and the whole thing is done \"twice\". But since \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb, perhaps this is a problem. But according to the rules, maybe \"turn opposite right\" is equivalent to \"turn left\", but we can't assume that. We must follow the rules strictly.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"turn\" here is a typo, but assuming the input is correct. Let's parse according to the rules. So \"turn opposite right\": according to rule 2, this is two turns right (I_TURN_RIGHT twice) followed by the verb. The verb here is \"turn\". But \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, this seems invalid. Unless \"turn\" here is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the verb is \"turn left\" or \"turn right\", but the input is \"turn opposite right\". Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the original verb is \"turn DIR\", and \"opposite\" applies to the direction. Let's think differently. For example, \"turn opposite left\" would mean \"turn right", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 55, "model_reflection": "The original interpretation of 'turn opposite right' as three I_TURN_RIGHT actions assumes that 'turn' is a valid primitive verb, which it is not according to the rules. The verb must be one of the defined primitives (I_WALK, I_RUN, I_JUMP, I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_RIGHT). Therefore, 'turn opposite right' should be interpreted as the primitive verb 'I_TURN_RIGHT' modified by 'opposite right', which according to Rule 2 means two turns right followed by the verb. This results in: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT. However, repeating this twice leads to six total actions, which is consistent with Rule 4. The same logic applies to the second part of the command.

The input is \"jump right twice and jump opposite right thrice\". Hmm, first, I need to parse each part according to the rules.\n\nStarting with \"jump right twice\". Wait, \"jump right\" would be the verb followed by a direction. But according to rule 1, the primitive verbs map to actions like I_JUMP, but the direction here might be part of the verb phrase. Wait, actually, the command is \"jump right\", which might be a single verb? Or is \"jump\" the verb and \"right\" a direction? Wait, no, looking at the rules, \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are mapped to I_TURN_LEFT and I_TURN_RIGHT. But in this case, \"jump right\" isn't a turn. Wait, maybe \"jump right\" is not a primitive verb. Wait, the primitive verbs listed are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump\" is a primitive verb, and \"right\" here might be part of a different construct. Wait, perhaps \"jump right\" isn't a primitive verb. Let me re-read the rules.\n\nRule 1 says primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump\" is a primitive verb. \"Turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitives. So \"jump right\" isn't a primitive. So maybe \"jump\" is the verb and \"right\" is a direction in a different part of the command. Wait, but how? Let me look at the example given: \"jump around right\" becomes four turns right and jumps. So in that case, \"jump\" is the verb and \"around right\" is the modifier. So in the current command, \"jump right twice\" – how is this parsed? Wait, \"jump right\" could be a verb, but according to rule 1, \"jump\" is a verb. So perhaps \"right\" here is part of a different construct. Let's break down the input.\n\nInput: \"jump right twice and jump opposite right thrice\"\n\nBreaking this into two parts connected by \"and\": \"jump right twice\" and \"jump opposite right thrice\".\n\nRule 5: \"A and B\" means do A then B.\n\nFirst part: \"jump right twice\". Hmm, the verb is \"jump\", but \"right\" here might be a direction. Wait, but according to the rules, how is direction handled? The example \"jump around right\" uses the \"around <DIR>\" rule. So maybe \"jump right\" would be \"jump\" with a direction modifier. Wait, but the rules don't mention direction modifiers except in the cases listed. Wait, perhaps \"jump right\" is not a primitive verb, but the \"right\" here is a direction modifier. But according to the rules, how do modifiers work?\n\nWait, looking at rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" means two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"opposite right\" would be two right turns then the verb. Rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"around right\" would be turn right, jump, repeat four times.\n\nBut in \"jump right twice\", \"right\" isn't preceded by \"opposite\" or \"around\". So perhaps \"jump right\" is just a jump followed by a right turn? No, but that's not clear. Wait, perhaps \"jump right\" is a mistake and the intended parsing is \"jump\" as the verb and \"right\" as a modifier. But how?\n\nWait, maybe \"jump right\" is a direction modifier for the verb. But according to the rules given, direction modifiers are handled via \"opposite\", \"around\", etc. So if the user says \"jump right\", that might not be a valid command unless it's part of a rule. Alternatively, perhaps the \"right\" here is a direction for a turn. Wait, but the command is \"jump right twice\". Let's think again.\n\nWait, maybe \"jump right\" is parsed as \"jump\" followed by a direction \"right\", but how does that fit into the rules? Alternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is a mistake and the correct parsing is \"jump\" modified by \"right\" via a rule. Alternatively, maybe \"right\" here is part of \"opposite right\" in the second part of the command. Wait, but the first part is \"jump right twice\", and the second part is \"jump opposite right thrice\", which uses \"opposite right\".\n\nLet me parse each part again.\n\nFirst part: \"jump right twice\".\n\nIs \"jump right\" a verb with direction, or is there a missing rule? According to the given rules and primitives, \"jump\" is a primitive verb. The direction \"right\" would be used in \"turn right\" or in \"opposite right\" or \"around right\". But here, the verb is \"jump\", so how does \"right\" apply?\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump right\" is not a valid command structure here. Maybe the user made a mistake, but as a parser, I need to apply the given rules. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"jump\" followed by a \"turn right\", but that's not stated in the rules. Hmm. Wait, but the problem is to process according to the given rules. So if the input is \"jump right\", but that's not matching any rule construct. Wait, unless \"right\" here is a direction modifier for the verb \"jump\", but according to the rules, direction modifiers are handled via \"opposite\" and \"around\". So perhaps \"jump right\" is just a jump followed by a right turn? Or maybe \"right\" here is not a modifier but a part of the verb, but since \"jump right\" isn't a primitive verb, that's not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended \"jump right\" as a direction, but according to the rules, the only way direction is handled is through \"opposite <DIR>\" and \"around <DIR>\". Therefore, \"jump right\" doesn't fit into any of the rules. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake here, but since the user provided this command, I need to parse it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump right\" is parsed as \"jump\" followed by a \"turn right\", but that's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\" and then \"jump\". Wait, but that's not stated. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the example: \"jump around right\" → 4 repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So in that case, the verb is \"jump\", modified by \"around right\". So \"around right\" means that you turn right and then jump, four times.\n\nSimilarly, \"opposite right\" would be two turns right and then the verb.\n\nBut how to parse \"jump right twice\"? The \"right\" here isn't part of a construct like \"opposite\" or \"around\". So maybe \"jump right\" is a mistake, but perhaps the user intended that \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"turn right then jump\"? But according to the rules, unless there's a rule that allows that, but the rules don't mention that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump right\" is a way to say \"jump\" and then \"turn right\", but again, not sure. Wait, perhaps the problem is that \"jump right\" isn't a valid construct here. Maybe the input is ambiguous, but given the rules, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that \"jump right\" is parsed as \"jump\" followed by \"turn right\", but I don't see a rule that allows that. Alternatively, maybe the \"right\" here is part of a missing rule. Alternatively, perhaps the command is \"jump right\" where \"right\" is not a direction but part of the verb, which isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a missing rule where a verb followed by a direction is equivalent to the verb followed by a turn. But according to the given rules, that's not present.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the user made a typo and the intended command is \"jump around right\" or \"jump opposite right\", but that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"right\" in \"jump right\" is a mistake, but as a parser, I need to proceed with the given input.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended \"jump right\" to mean \"jump\" as a verb and \"right\" as an adverb, but according to the given rules, such a modifier isn't defined. So maybe \"jump right twice\" is parsed as \"jump\" followed by \"right twice\", but that's not possible. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is a mistake and the correct parsing is \"jump\" followed by \"right twice\", but \"right\" isn't a verb. This is confusing.\n\nWait, let's take the other part of the command: \"jump opposite right thrice\". According to rule 2, \"opposite right\" means two turns right then the verb. So \"jump opposite right\" would mean \"jump\" modified by \"opposite right\", so the action would be two turns right and then a jump, and then that sequence repeated thrice?\n\nWait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"jump opposite right\" would be two turns right then jump.\n\nBut then, \"jump opposite right thrice\" would be repeating that sequence (two turns right and jump) three times?\n\nWait, no. Wait, rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if \"opposite right\" is part of the verb sequence, then \"jump opposite right thrice\" would be the sequence of two turns right and jump, then repeated thrice.\n\nWait", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 50, "model_reflection": "The initial interpretation of 'jump right twice' as (I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT) twice was incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is intended as \"jump\" with a direction modifier, but according to the rules, directions only apply via turn or around.

But given the rules, maybe \"jump twice\", but the input says \"jump right twice\". Alternatively, maybe it's a compound command where \"jump right\" is interpreted as \"jump\" followed by \"turn right\", then \"twice\". But how?\n\nWait, the user wrote \"jump right twice\".

But the input is \"jump right twice\", not \"jump and turn right twice\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended \"jump around right twice\", but wrote \"jump right twice\". Since this is a problem, perhaps the intended parsing is \"jump\" twice, ignoring the \"right\", but that's not likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump right twice\" is parsed as \"jump\" followed by \"turn right twice\", but that's \"jump then turn right twice\".\n\nBut according to the rules, \"A and B\" = A then B. So if \"jump right\" was \"jump and right\", but \"right\" is not a verb. Hmm.\n\nThis is a problem. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that \"jump right\" is a mistake, and that the intended command is \"jump twice\", but the user added \"right\" erroneously. However, the example uses direction in the command \"jump around right\", which affects the verb via the \"around right\" modifier. So \"jump right\" may not be a valid construct. Given the time, perhaps the intended parsing is:\n\nSecond part: \"jump right twice\" → \"jump twice\" (ignoring the invalid right), but that's not satisfying.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is \"jump after right\", which would be \"right then jump\", but \"twice\" applied.\n\nWait, \"jump right twice\" could be \"jump\" modified by \"right twice\", but how?\n\nAlternatively, if \"jump right\" is treated as \"jump\" and \"turn right\", then \"jump and turn right twice\". But the input is \"jump right twice\", which might be \"jump right\" twice. But \"jump right\" as a compound action. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and \"jump right\" should be \"turn right and jump\", but that complicates.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the correct answer is:\n\nThe first part is four I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nThe second part: \"jump right twice\" – if \"jump\" is done twice, ignoring the \"right\", then two I_JUMP.\n\nBut the example uses \"jump around right\" which includes turning right and jumping four times. So perhaps \"jump right\" is supposed to be \"jump\" while facing right, but that requires prior turns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump right twice\" is \"turn right and jump twice\". No, not according to rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is parsed as \"turn right\" followed by \"jump\", then \"twice\" would repeat that. So:\n\n[turn right jump] twice. So \"jump right\" = turn right then jump, done twice.\n\nBut according to the rules, \"jump right\" isn't a primitive. But the example uses \"jump around right\" as four times [turn right jump]. So maybe \"jump right\" is intended to be similar to \"around right\" but only once? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended \"jump\" followed by \"turn right\", twice. But that would be a different structure.\n\nGiven the confusion and time, I'll proceed:\n\nFirst part: \"turn opposite right twice\" → each \"turn opposite right\" is two right turns, and done twice: 2 * 2 = four right turns.\n\nSecond part: \"jump right twice\" – if \"jump\" is the verb and \"right\" is a mistake, then \"jump twice\" = two I_JUMP.\n\nCombined via \"A and B\" (A then B):\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_JUMP\n\nBut wait, the example for \"jump around right\" includes turning right before each jump. So maybe \"jump right\" implies turning right before the jump? But there's no rule for that. Alternatively, \"jump right\" could be parsed as \"turn right then jump\", and \"twice\" would repeat that. So for \"jump right twice\", it would be [I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP] twice. That would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nIf that's the case, then the entire answer would be:\n\nFirst part: four I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSecond part: [I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP] twice.\n\nCombined:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nBut wait, why would \"jump right\" parse to \"turn right then jump\"? Only because the example uses \"around right\" as turning right before each jump. But the rules don't specify that a direction after a verb without a modifier word like \"around\" or \"opposite\" should be interpreted that way. This is a stretch. But given the example, perhaps this is the intended approach.\n\nAlternatively, the second part \"jump right twice\" could be \"jump\" done twice, and \"right\" is a mistake. But the former approach seems more plausible.\n\nSo final answer:\n\nFirst part: turn opposite right twice = [I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT] repeated twice: four turns right.\n\nSecond part: jump right twice = each jump preceded by turn right, done twice: so [turn right jump] twice. So two turns right and two jumps.\n\nWait, no. If \"jump right\" is parsed as turn right then jump, then \"twice\" would repeat that sequence. So each iteration is turn right then jump. Twice → two turns right, jump, turn right, jump. So total two turns right, two jumps.\n\nWait, no:\n\nEach repetition is [turn right jump], twice: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nSo combining everything:\n\nFirst part: four I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSecond part: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nFull sequence:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nBut this would be five right turns and two jumps.\n\nBut I'm not sure. The problem is ambiguous, but based on the rules provided, perhaps the second part \"jump right twice\" doesn't include turning, so the correct parsing is \"jump\" twice. Therefore:\n\nFinal answer:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_JUMP\n\nBut the example uses \"jump around right\" as four [turn right jump], so perhaps the direction modifier in the second part requires a similar approach. Given that the user might expect that \"jump right\" would involve turning right before jumping, but without an explicit \"around\" or \"after\", it's unclear. Given the problem's example, perhaps the intended parsing is the second part being [turn right jump] twice.\n\nThus:\n\nFirst part: 4 I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSecond part: [turn right jump] twice → I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nFull:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nBut I'm uncertain. However, given the rules strictly, since \"jump right\" isn't a primitive verb, the parser might ignore \"right\" or flag an error. But assuming the user intended something, perhaps the second part is \"jump\" twice, so two I_JUMP. Therefore, the answer would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_JUMP\n\nBut I'll go with this.", "model_reasoning": "Okay, let's break down the command step by step. The input is \"turn opposite right twice and jump right twice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part. Starting with \"turn opposite right twice\". According to rule 2, \"opposite right\" means two turns in the right direction. So \"turn opposite right\" would be two right turns. Then \"twice\" means repeating that sequence twice. So each \"turn opposite right\" is two I_TURN_RIGHT actions, and doing that twice would be four I_TURN_RIGHT in total? Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, \"turn opposite right\" is two turns right. Then \"twice\" applies to that entire verb sequence. So each \"turn opposite right\" is two turns right, and doing that twice would be repeating that sequence. So first part would be two right turns, then another two right turns, totaling four right turns? But wait, the \"twice\" applies to the verb. Hmm, the original phrase is \"turn opposite right twice\". Let me see: \"turn opposite right\" is the verb here. So \"turn opposite right\" is equivalent to two turns right. Then \"twice\" means repeat that verb sequence twice. So yes, two turns right, then two turns right again. So four turns right total. But wait, each \"turn opposite right\" is two right turns. So doing that twice would be [turn right, turn right] repeated twice. So that's four right turns.\n\nThen the second part is \"jump right twice\". So \"jump right\" is the verb here? Wait, no. Wait, \"jump right\" might be parsed as the verb jump in the direction right. Wait, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are mapped as \"jump\", which is I_JUMP. The direction is part of the verb? Wait, in the example, \"jump around right\" becomes four times [turn right + jump]. Wait, the example input \"jump around right\" becomes four times [turn right, jump], so each time you turn right then jump. So the verb here is \"jump\", and \"around right\" applies to the verb. So in this case, the original input \"jump right twice\" – how is this parsed? Wait, the command is \"jump right twice\". Hmm. The rules don't mention direction in the verb. Wait, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump right\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, but \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitives. So perhaps \"jump right\" is not a primitive verb. So how to parse \"jump right\"? Wait, maybe it's a mistake. Wait, the input is \"jump right twice\". Hmm, perhaps the user meant to do \"jump\" and then \"turn right\", but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe \"jump right\" is a misstatement. Wait, but according to the rules, only the verbs listed are primitives. So \"jump\" is a primitive, but \"jump right\" isn't. Therefore, perhaps the user intended \"jump\" in a direction, but according to the given rules, that's not a primitive. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but we have to parse according to the rules. Wait, but the example input \"jump around right\" is parsed as four times [turn right + jump], so \"jump\" is the verb. So \"jump right\" here might not be a valid primitive, which complicates things. Wait, maybe the input is \"jump after right\" but that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe \"jump right\" is a misstatement and should be parsed as \"jump\" followed by a direction. But according to the given rules, perhaps the correct way is to treat \"jump\" as the verb, and \"right\" as part of a different command. Wait, but the user input is \"jump right twice\". Let me check the rules again. Rule 1 lists the primitive verbs. So \"jump\" is a verb. \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are separate verbs. So \"jump right\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, perhaps the user intended \"jump\" followed by \"right\", but that doesn't fit the rules. Alternatively, maybe \"jump right\" should be interpreted as \"jump\" with a direction modifier, but according to the rules, directions are handled via the \"around\" and \"opposite\" constructs. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the correct parsing is \"jump\" modified by \"right\" in some way. But according to the given rules, \"jump around right\" would be four times [turn right + jump]. So maybe \"jump right twice\" here is a sequence of \"jump\" followed by \"right\", but \"right\" isn't a verb. Alternatively, maybe the user intended \"turn right\" and \"jump right\" but that's not a primitive. This is confusing. Wait, but the original command is \"turn opposite right twice and jump right twice\". Let's split the problem into parts.\n\nFirst part: \"turn opposite right twice\"\n\nSecond part: \"jump right twice\"\n\nThe first part: \"turn opposite right\" is a verb. According to rule 2, \"opposite right\" means two turns in the right direction. So \"turn opposite right\" would be two I_TURN_RIGHT. Then \"twice\" applies to this verb, so repeat the entire verb sequence twice. Therefore, two I_TURN_RIGHT repeated twice: that would be [I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT] [I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT], totaling four I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nThen the second part: \"jump right twice\". Hmm. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump\" is a verb. \"Right\" here is a problem. Since \"turn right\" is a verb, but \"jump\" followed by right isn't. So maybe \"jump right\" here is a mistake, but according to the rules, how to parse? Or maybe \"jump\" and \"turn right\"? But the user wrote \"jump right twice\". Alternatively, perhaps \"jump around right\" would be different, but here it's \"jump right twice\". Alternatively, maybe \"jump\" is the verb, and \"right\" is part of a different command. Wait, but the rules don't specify direction with verbs except in the case of the turn commands. So perhaps the correct parsing is \"jump\" followed by \"turn right\", but that's not indicated in the input. Wait, but the user wrote \"jump right twice\". Let's think again. Maybe the user intended \"jump\" and then \"turn right\", done twice. But the problem is that the input is \"jump right twice\". The problem is whether \"jump right\" is a verb. If not, then perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the user made an error. But given that the example uses \"jump around right\", where the direction is part of the around modifier, perhaps \"jump right twice\" is invalid. But assuming the problem is valid and we need to parse it. Wait, perhaps \"jump right\" is supposed to be \"turn right\" followed by \"jump\"? No, but the rules don't state that. Alternatively, maybe \"jump\" is a verb, and \"right\" is a direction, but according to the rules, there's no such primitive. Therefore, maybe the correct approach is to ignore the \"right\" in \"jump right twice\", but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is a misstatement, and the correct command is \"turn right and jump twice\", but that's speculation. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended \"jump\" with the \"right\" being a modifier indicating repetition. But according to the rules, \"twice\" applies to the verb. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the \"jump right twice\" is \"jump\" followed by \"right twice\", but \"right twice\" isn't a verb. This is a problem. Wait, maybe the \"right\" here refers to direction, but the only verbs that take direction are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". So \"jump right\" is not a valid primitive. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake, but as a parser, we need to handle it. Alternatively, maybe \"jump right\" is a typo and should be \"turn right\", but we can't assume that. Wait, perhaps the \"right\" in \"jump right twice\" is part of a compound command. Let's think differently. The second part is \"jump right twice\". According to rule 4, \"around <DIR>\" is a modifier. But here there's no around. Rule 3: around. But \"jump right twice\" isn't using that. Rule 5: \"A and B\" is A then B. So the overall command is \"A and B\", where A is \"turn opposite right twice\" and B is \"jump right twice\". So perhaps the user intended B to be \"jump\" twice, but with a \"right\" modifier. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is a mistake, and the intended command is \"jump twice and turn right twice\". But I can't assume that. Another angle: maybe \"jump right\" is a verb. But according to the rules, it's not. So perhaps the input is invalid, but the problem expects us to parse it. Alternatively, maybe the \"right\" here is a direction modifier for the jump, but according to the rules, the only way to handle direction is via turn or via around. So maybe \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"jump\", ignoring the \"right\" because it's not a valid primitive. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is a mistake, and the correct command should be \"turn right and jump\", but again, not sure. Let's think again. The example input \"jump around right\" produces [turn right, jump", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 60, "model_reflection": "The original parsing of 'jump right twice' as four actions (I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP) assumes that 'jump right' implies a turn followed by a jump, which is not explicitly supported by the given rules.

There is no rule that directly supports interpreting 'jump right' as 'turn right then jump'. Therefore, this interpretation introduces an assumption not grounded in the provided grammar. A more reasonable parsing would either treat 'jump right twice' as invalid (ignoring 'right'), or attempt to apply rule 5 or 6 to 'jump' and 'right twice', though 'right' alone is not a valid action without a verb.

Let's start by identifying the components.\n\nThe main structure here is \"A after B\", which means we need to do B first, then A. So according to rule 6, \"run opposite right\" is A, and \"walk left\" is B. Wait, no. Wait the original command is \"run opposite right after walk left\". The structure is \"A after B\", so the entire \"run opposite right\" is A, and B is \"walk left\". But according to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So first do B (walk left), then do A (run opposite right). \n\nBut wait, wait. Let me re-express the original input. The command is \"run opposite right after walk left\". So the \"after\" separates the two parts. So the user wants to perform \"walk left\" first, and then \"run opposite right\". But wait, no: the rule says \"A after B\" means do B then A. So the structure is A after B → B followed by A. So in this case, the command is \"run opposite right after walk left\". So A is \"run opposite right\", and B is \"walk left\". So the order would be B then A. Therefore, first walk left, then run opposite right. \n\nNow, breaking down \"run opposite right\". The word \"opposite right\" refers to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" means two turns in DIR then the verb. So opposite right would be two turns to the right (I_TURN_RIGHT twice), then the verb. The verb here is \"run\", so the sequence would be I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_RUN. \n\nWait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. So the verb is part of the \"opposite\" action. Wait, but the original phrase is \"run opposite right\". So the \"opposite right\" is modifying the direction of the run? Or is \"opposite right\" the direction of the run? Hmm. Wait, according to the example in the rules: \"jump around right\" maps to turning right then jumping four times. So in that example, the \"around right\" is a modifier for the jump. Similarly, \"opposite right\" would modify the direction of the run. So \"run opposite right\" means that the running is done in the opposite right direction. Which according to rule 2 would be two turns right, then run. Wait, but the rule says \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So the entire action is two turns in the DIR direction, then perform the verb. So in this case, \"run opposite right\" would be two right turns, then run. So the verb is \"run\", so the action sequence is two I_TURN_RIGHT followed by I_RUN.\n\nSo \"run opposite right\" becomes I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN.\n\nThen, the other part is \"walk left\", which is straightforward: I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK. Because \"left\" is a direction, so according to the primitive verbs, turn left is a single action. Wait, the primitive verbs are: turn left maps to I_TURN_LEFT, so \"walk left\" would be first turning left and then walking. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the primitive verbs are as per rule 1: \"walk\" → I_WALK, \"turn left\" → I_TURN_LEFT. So if the command is \"walk left\", is that considered \"turn left then walk\"? Or is \"walk left\" equivalent to moving forward left? Hmm. Wait, according to the example given in the problem: \"jump around right\" maps to four repetitions of [turn right + jump], which starts with turn right. So when you have a verb followed by a direction, like \"walk left\", maybe that's equivalent to \"turn left then walk\". But according to the rules, rule 1 says that \"turn left\" maps to I_TURN_LEFT. So perhaps \"walk left\" is equivalent to \"turn left then walk\". But how?\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions: walk→I_WALK, run→I_RUN, jump→I_JUMP, turn left→I_TURN_LEFT, turn right→I_TURN_RIGHT.\"\n\nAh, okay. So the primitive verbs are either just the action (like walk) or turn directions. So \"walk left\" is not a primitive verb. Wait, the way the problem is presented, the primitive verbs are the ones listed. So \"walk\", \"run\", etc., are primitives, but \"walk left\" is a compound command. Wait, perhaps \"walk left\" is a command that involves turning left and then walking. Because \"turn left\" is a primitive verb. So according to rule 5, \"A and B\" is A followed by B, so \"walk left\" may be equivalent to \"turn left and walk\", which would be I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK. But how do we know? Wait, the problem says \"walk left\" is part of the input. The example input is \"jump around right\" which outputs a series of turns and jumps. So in the problem, the input commands can include modifiers like \"around right\" or \"opposite right\", which modify the verb. So \"walk left\" would be a different case. Wait, \"left\" here could be a direction, but according to the rules given, the primitive verbs are \"turn left\" → I_TURN_LEFT. So perhaps \"walk left\" is not a primitive, but a combination of a turn and then a walk. Wait, but how is \"walk left\" parsed? Let's think.\n\nIn the example given, \"jump around right\" uses rule 3, which is \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"around right\" modifies the verb. Similarly, \"opposite right\" modifies the verb. But if the command is \"walk left\" without any modifiers, how is that parsed? Wait, perhaps \"left\" here is a direction modifier. But according to the rules provided, the only modifiers are \"opposite <DIR>\", \"around <DIR>\", and \"twice\", \"thrice\", etc. So perhaps \"walk left\" is a simple command where the direction is left. But according to the rules, maybe \"walk left\" is equivalent to \"turn left then walk\". Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"walk left\" is equivalent to the action I_WALK_LEFT, but according to the problem's rules, the primitive verbs are mapped to specific actions. Since the problem lists \"turn left\" as mapping to I_TURN_LEFT, but \"walk left\" isn't listed. So perhaps \"left\" in this case is a direction modifier that requires turning. So in order to walk left, the agent must first turn left, then walk. But how?\n\nHmm, this is a bit ambiguous. However, looking at the example: \"jump around right\" leads to four turns right and jumps each time. So in that case, \"around right\" is a modifier that requires turning right each time before jumping. So perhaps the direction modifiers are handled via turning. Therefore, a command like \"walk left\" would be equivalent to \"turn left and walk\", which would be I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK. But since the problem's rules don't explicitly state that, maybe I need to infer based on existing rules.\n\nWait, the rules don't cover \"verb direction\" directly. So perhaps the input \"walk left\" is not possible unless there's a rule to handle it, but in the given problem, the input here is \"run opposite right after walk left\". So \"walk left\" is a part of the input. Since the rules don't have a specific rule for a verb followed by a direction (like \"walk left\"), except for the modifiers like \"opposite\", \"around\", etc. Hmm. Wait, perhaps \"walk left\" is equivalent to \"walk to the left\", which would require turning left first and then moving. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"walk left\" is a primitive command. But according to the problem's first rule, \"walk\" maps to I_WALK, and \"turn left\" maps to I_TURN_LEFT. So there's no direct mapping for \"walk left\". Therefore, perhaps \"walk left\" is a combination of turning left and then walking. Wait, but that would be the same as \"turn left then walk\". However, according to rule 5, \"A and B\" would be A followed by B. But the input \"walk left\" isn't using \"and\". So perhaps the problem is that the input \"walk left\" here is not a valid command? Or perhaps the user made a mistake. But given that the input is given as \"walk left\", we need to parse it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"left\" here refers to the direction of the walk. But according to the rules, the way to handle direction modifiers would be via the existing rules. For example, \"around right\" or \"opposite left\". Since \"walk left\" isn't covered by the existing rules, perhaps \"left\" here is a separate turn. Wait, perhaps \"walk left\" is equivalent to \"turn left and walk\", which would be I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK. But how can we confirm?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"walk left\" is a typo and should be \"turn left and walk\", but given that it's in the input, we have to work with it. Let's proceed under the assumption that \"walk left\" is parsed as \"turn left then walk\", because otherwise, there's no way to map it. So \"walk left\" would be I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK.\n\nWait,", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The initial parsing correctly applies the defined rules.

Wait, the rules don't mention \"look\" as a primitive verb. That's confusing. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe rules state: Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. The listed primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" isn't a primitive. Therefore, perhaps the input is invalid, but the user expects us to process it. Wait, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\"? Or maybe \"look\" here is supposed to be \"turn left\"? No, the example uses \"jump around right\" which is a valid command. Hmm. Wait, maybe \"look\" in this context is a direction? Like \"look left\" meaning turn left. But that is unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that \"look\" is a verb that's not in the primitives, which would mean the command is invalid. But since the user provided this, I need to proceed.\n\nWait, maybe \"look opposite right\" is a way to say turn directions. Let me think. Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"opposite right\" would be two turns right, then the verb. But what is the verb here? The verb here is \"look\". But since \"look\" isn't a primitive, how do we handle it? This is a problem. But maybe the original input was supposed to be \"turn opposite right twice\", or maybe \"look\" is supposed to be \"turn left\"? Or perhaps the user intended \"look\" as a direction, like \"left\" and \"right\". Alternatively, maybe \"look\" here is a mistake and should be ignored, or perhaps it's a typo. Since the problem gives this input, maybe we have to proceed even if \"look\" isn't a valid primitive. Wait, but according to the rules, all verbs must be primitives. Therefore, this input might be invalid. However, the user expects an answer here, so maybe \"look\" is a typo. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a direction, but in the problem, directions are left/right. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a mistake, and the correct command is \"turn opposite right twice\", which would make sense.\n\nWait, but the example input was \"jump around right\", which maps to turning right and jumping. So \"jump\" is a verb. So in the current input, \"look opposite right twice\" – if \"look\" is a verb not in the primitives, then this is a problem. However, maybe the user intended \"look\" as a direction. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is \"turn to face a direction\", which would be a turn action. So perhaps \"look\" here is equivalent to a turn. But according to the rules, \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitives. So maybe \"look left\" is equivalent to \"turn left\", and \"look right\" to \"turn right\". If that's the case, then \"look opposite right twice\" would be processed as follows:\n\nFirst, \"opposite right\" is two turns right. Then, the verb is \"look\" which would be a turn left. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, according to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" means two turns in DIR then the verb. So the structure is: two turns in DIR direction, then perform the verb. So \"look opposite right\" would be interpreted as two turns right, then \"look\". But again, \"look\" isn't a primitive. So perhaps this is a trick question, but given that the user provided the input, we have to work with it. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" here is a typo and should be \"run\" or \"walk\". Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"look\" is a typo in the problem's input, but given that the user wrote \"look opposite right twice and jump left twice\", we have to proceed. Wait, but maybe \"look\" is a typo and should be \"walk\" or another primitive. But without more info, perhaps we have to proceed as per the given input, even if \"look\" isn't a valid primitive. But that would result in an invalid action. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" here is a typo for \"jump left\" or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look\" here refers to a direction, but that seems unclear. Let's try to assume that \"look\" is a typo and the correct command is \"walk opposite right twice and jump left twice\". But the user wrote \"look\", so this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is intended to be a new primitive, but according to the problem's rules, the primitives are fixed. Therefore, this command is invalid. However, the example shows that even if the structure is correct, the user expects an answer. So perhaps the problem's input is correct, but we need to parse \"look\" as a verb and map it to something. But according to rule 1, the only mappings are for the listed primitives. Therefore, \"look\" is not a valid verb. Therefore, the input is invalid. But the user is expecting us to process it, so perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, maybe \"look\" here refers to a direction. For example, \"look left\" would be equivalent to \"turn left\". But that's not specified in the rules. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and \"look\" should be \"turn left\". But without knowing, this complicates things. Let's proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a verb, even if it's not listed in the primitives, and therefore the output would include \"LOOK\" as an action. But according to the rules, only the uppercase actions listed are allowed. But in that case, the output would not be valid. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a typo and should be \"walk\", which would map to I_WALK.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's example includes \"jump around right\" which maps to the I_JUMP action. So each time, after turning, you jump. So the verb here is the primitive. So \"look\" must be a verb. If \"look\" is not a primitive verb, then it's invalid. But the problem gives this as input, so perhaps there's an error in the problem setup, or perhaps the user intended \"look\" to be a valid primitive. But according to the given rules, it's not. Therefore, perhaps the answer should ignore the \"look\" part? No, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" here refers to the action of turning to face a direction, which would be equivalent to a turn. So \"look opposite right twice\" would involve turning. Let's try to proceed with that assumption, even though it's a stretch.\n\nSo, breaking down \"look opposite right twice\":\n\nRule 2: \"opposite right\" means two turns right, then the verb. So first, the verb here is \"look\", but assuming \"look\" is a primitive, which it's not. But if we proceed regardless, perhaps \"look\" would be an action, like I_LOOK, but according to the rules, it's not. So this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the input. However, given that we have to process this input, maybe we can proceed by treating \"look\" as a typo for \"jump\". Or perhaps the verb is \"jump left twice\" and the first part is \"opposite right twice\". Alternatively, perhaps the command is \"walk opposite right twice and jump left twice\", which would make sense. But the user wrote \"look\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input is miswritten, and the correct input would be \"turn opposite right twice and jump left twice\". If that's the case, then \"turn opposite right\" would be two turns right, then turn action. But given the uncertainty, perhaps this is a trick question. However, given that the user provided this input, I'll have to proceed with the given command, even if \"look\" isn't a primitive. Let's proceed by treating \"look\" as a verb that maps to I_LOOK, even if it's not in the rules. Otherwise, we can't proceed. So assuming that the primitive verbs can include others, but according to the problem's rule 1, only those listed are mapped. So this would be invalid, but perhaps the answer should include \"LOOK\" as part of the action.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\", which would be I_WALK. Let's proceed with that assumption. Let's say \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\". Then:\n\nFirst part: \"look opposite right twice\" → walk opposite right twice.\n\nBreaking down \"walk opposite right\":\n\nRule 2: opposite right = two turns right, then walk.\n\nSo the sequence would be I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_W", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 90, "model_reflection": "The original response correctly identified that 'look' is not a defined primitive verb in the rules, but proceeded under the assumption that it maps to a valid action (e.g., I_LOOK), which is a reasonable interpretation to allow for parsing.

The rule for \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb is walk, and the direction is right. So \"walk around right\" would be turning right and walking four times. But then there's \"thrice\", which means repeat the entire sequence three times. Wait, wait. Wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of turn and verb.

Hmm, so in this case, \"walk around right thrice\" would mean that the entire \"around right\" part is considered a verb sequence, and then we repeat that three times?\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. The rule says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if the original verb is modified by \"around\", which is a modifier. So perhaps \"walk around right\" is a single verb sequence. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeating that entire sequence three times.\n\nBut wait, the example given was \"jump around right\" becomes four repetitions of turning right then jumping.

So how do these combine?\n\nLet's parse \"walk around right thrice\". \n\n\"around right\" would turn it into 4 repetitions of [turn right, walk]. Then \"thrice\" would take that entire sequence (which is walk around right) and repeat it three times. So first, walk around right once, then repeat that entire sequence three times total. Wait, no. Wait, the wording for rule 4 says \"repeat the verb sequence twice\". So if the verb sequence is modified by \"around\", then \"twice\" would repeat that modified sequence. So \"walk around right thrice\" would be the modified verb sequence (which is 4*[turn right, walk]) repeated three times. So each time, you do the 4 turns and walks, and then do that three times. But wait, no. Wait, \"around right\" is 4 repetitions of [turn right + verb]. So \"walk around right\" would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK repeated 4 times.

Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the original example for \"jump around right\" gives the output as four pairs of I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP. Then the output is four turns right followed by jumps. So each around right is four times [turn right then jump]. So for \"walk around right\", it's four times [turn right, walk], so each time, turn right, walk, then repeat that four times.\n\nNow, \"walk around right thrice\" would be repeating the entire \"walk around right\" sequence three times. Wait, but according to rule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if the verb sequence is modified by around, then \"thrice\" would apply to the modified verb. So \"walk around right thrice\" would be equivalent to: [walk around right] three times. But each \"walk around right\" is 4*(turn right, walk). So the total would be three times that 4-step sequence, making three * four steps each?\n\nBut wait, perhaps \"around right\" is a modifier. Let me re-express this. The structure is \"walk around right thrice\". The \"around right\" modifies the verb walk. Then \"thrice\" modifies the entire verb sequence. So each \"around\" is a repetition of the [turn and walk] four times. Then \"thrice\" would mean that the entire \"walk around right\" action (which is four pairs) is done three times. Wait, but that would result in 3 * 4 * 2 actions (each pair is turn and walk). Alternatively, maybe \"walk around right thrice\" would be that each of the around repetitions is done thrice. But according to the rules, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the order of modifiers matters. The original rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Then rule 4 says \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"walk around right thrice\" would parse as: the verb is 'walk', modified by 'around right' (which makes it 4 times [turn right + walk]), and then modified by 'thrice' which would repeat that entire sequence three times. So the entire \"walk around right\" is done three times. That would be 3 times the 4 repetitions of [turn right, walk]. Wait, but each \"walk around right\" is already four pairs. So doing that thrice would mean four pairs three times. Which would be 3 * (4 pairs), but each pair is turn and walk, so each pair is two actions. So the total would be 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 actions. But wait, in the example, \"jump around right\" gives four pairs of turn right and jump, so each around is four times the pair. So yes, that would be the case.\n\nTherefore, \"walk around right thrice\" would be the \"around right\" sequence (four times turn and walk) repeated three times. Wait, no. Wait, the 'thrice' would apply to the verb sequence. Rule 4 says that \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if the verb is 'walk around right', then 'thrice' would repeat that entire verb sequence three times. But 'walk around right' is itself a verb modified by around. So each time, you do the around right (four times turn right and walk), then three times that entire block.\n\nBut then the command is \"walk around right thrice and walk around left\". The \"and\" means do the first then the second. So first, \"walk around right thrice\", then \"walk around left\".\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nFirst part: walk around right thrice.\n\nBreaking that down: walk around right is done thrice.\n\nwalk around right → four times [turn right, walk]. Then thrice → repeat that thrice. So each time, you have four pairs. So thrice would make three times the four pairs. Wait, no. Wait, no: when you repeat the verb sequence thrice. The verb sequence here is \"walk around right\". So each time you do \"walk around right\", which is four pairs, and then repeat that three times. So the total for the first part is three times the four pairs. So each \"walk around right\" is four pairs, and three times that would be three blocks of four pairs each. So total of 3 * 4 pairs = 12 pairs. Each pair is I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK.\n\nWait, but according to the example, \"jump around right\" gives four turns and jumps. But the output is four turns right and four jumps? Wait, the example input is \"jump around right\" → output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, wait. Wait in the example, the output for \"jump around right\" is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times, but looking at the output:\n\nThe example output is: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, that's four times the turn and jump. Let's count. Each turn and jump pair. How many turns and jumps?\n\nBreaking down the example:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nRule 3 says around <DIR> = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is one turn and one verb. So four times [turn right, jump].\n\nSo four pairs would be: turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump. Then the next turn right? Wait, in the output:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP four times. Let's see:\n\nFirst pair: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nSecond: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nThird: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nFourth: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nAnd then the output ends with I_TURN_RIGHT. Wait, wait, in the example output, the user wrote:\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, that's 4 I_TURN_RIGHT and 4 I_JUMP, but the final count of I_TURN_RIGHT is 5? Let me count:\n\nNumber of actions:\n\nEach pair starts with a turn, then a jump. But four pairs would have four turns and four jumps? Or wait, no. Wait, each repetition is [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is two actions. So four repetitions would be 4 turns and 4 verbs, each pair as separate actions.\n\nWait, four repetitions of [turn right, jump] would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nWhich is 8 actions (four turns and four jumps).

The input is \"run left twice after turn around right thrice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part according to the rules. Let's start with \"run left twice\". Wait, the command says \"run left\", but according to the rules, \"run\" is a primitive verb mapping to I_RUN. But \"left\" here might be part of the direction. Wait, no. Wait, the original command might have a typo? Wait, the user input is \"run left twice after turn around right thrice\". Hmm. Wait, the example in the rules shows that \"turn left\" maps to I_TURN_LEFT. So if the command is \"run left\", that's not a standard primitive verb. Wait, but the rules say that the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"run left\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, maybe that's a mistake in the input. Wait, perhaps the input should be \"run twice after turn around right thrice\", but the user wrote \"run left twice after...\". Hmm. Wait, maybe the user made a typo, but according to the given input, it's \"run left twice after turn around right thrice\". Let me check again.\n\nWait, the input is \"run left twice after turn around right thrice\". So \"run left\" is part of the command. But according to rule 1, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"run left\" isn't a primitive verb. So maybe the user intended \"run left\" as a direction? Wait, but the rules don't mention directions for run. Hmm. Wait, perhaps \"run left\" is a misinterpretation here. Alternatively, maybe there's a missing \"turn\" before \"left\" in the input. But according to the given input, it's \"run left twice after turn around right thrice\". Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the original command is structured as \"run left twice after [turn around right thrice]\". Wait, but according to the grammar, maybe \"run left\" is supposed to be parsed as \"run\" modified by \"left\". But according to the rules, \"left\" alone isn't a direction unless part of a turn. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but we need to parse it as per the input.\n\nWait, perhaps \"run left\" is a typo and should be \"turn left\", but the example in the rules shows that \"jump around right\" becomes multiple turns and jumps. Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is meant to be \"run\" followed by turning left? Or maybe \"run left\" is supposed to be a direction, but the rules don't have that. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, maybe the problem is a misstatement, and the actual command is \"run twice after turn around right thrice\". But the user input is as given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"left\" here refers to a direction, so \"run left\" would be a run command, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are only the ones listed. Wait, the rules say primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So \"run\" is a primitive verb, but \"run left\" is not. So maybe the input has an error, but perhaps \"run left\" is intended to be \"turn left\" followed by \"run\"? No, that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input is \"run left\" as in \"run in the left direction\", but the rules don't cover that. So maybe \"run left\" is a typo and should be \"turn left\". But the user input is as given, so perhaps the correct approach is to parse it as per the given words, even if it's not a valid primitive verb. But according to the rules, any verb not in the primitive list would not be recognized. Wait, but the problem must be solvable. Let me try to parse again.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is \"run left twice after turn around right thrice\". Let's split into parts. The main structure is \"A after B\", which according to rule 6 means B then A. So A is \"run left twice\" and B is \"turn around right thrice\".\n\nFirst, process B: \"turn around right thrice\". Let's parse \"turn around right\". According to rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb is \"turn\", but wait, the original command is \"turn around right thrice\". Wait, no. Wait, the B part is \"turn around right thrice\". Let's parse this. \"around right\" would be rule 3: four times [turn right + turn]. Wait, because the verb here would be \"turn\", but then \"turn around right\" would be expanding into 4 repetitions of [turn right + turn]. Wait, but \"turn around right\" would be interpreted as \"around right\" modifying \"turn\", which is a verb. So according to rule 3: around right → 4 repetitions of [turn right + verb]. The verb here is \"turn\". So each repetition would be turn right then turn. Then four times. Then, the entire thing is multiplied by \"thrice\" (rule 4: repeat thrice). Wait, no. Let's parse \"turn around right thrice\". So first, \"around right\" would be rule 3: four repetitions of [turn right + turn]. So the sequence would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN, repeated four times. Then \"thrice\" (rule 4 again?) No, rule 4 says \"verb twice\" is repeat twice, similarly for thrice. Wait, rule 4 says: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if the verb is \"turn around right\", then \"thrice\" would apply to that entire verb. Hmm. Wait, the command is \"turn around right thrice\". Let's parse \"turn around right\" first. According to rule 3: \"around right\" = 4 repetitions of [turn right + verb]. Here, the verb is \"turn\". So each step is turn right, then turn. So each repetition is I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN. Repeating 4 times would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN.\n\nWait, no. Wait, rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is [turn DIR + verb], so four times. So for \"around right\", the verb is \"turn\", so each repetition is I_TURN_RIGHT followed by I_TURN. So four times would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN (x4)\n\nWhich becomes:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN.\n\nThat's the \"around right\" part. Now, the command says \"turn around right thrice\". Wait, the \"thrice\" applies to the verb \"turn around right\". So according to rule 4: \"verb thrice\" means repeat the verb sequence three times. So the entire \"around right\" sequence (which is 8 actions) would be repeated three times. So B becomes this 8-action sequence repeated thrice, totaling 24 actions.\n\nNow, moving to A: \"run left twice\". Wait, the problem is how to parse \"run left twice\". According to the rules, \"run\" is a primitive verb. But \"left\" here could be a direction modifier. Wait, but according to the rules, \"opposite <DIR>\" and \"around <DIR>\" are modifiers. So \"run left\" could be \"run\" modified by \"left\", but there's no rule for directions. Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is supposed to be \"run\" after \"turn left\", but not sure. Wait, the user input is \"run left twice after turn around right thrice\". Wait, but \"run left twice\" could be parsed as \"run\" modified by \"left twice\", but according to the rules, \"twice\" applies to the verb. Let's see:\n\nRule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice.\n\nSo \"run left twice\" would be parsed as \"run left\" as the verb, then \"twice\" meaning repeat that verb twice. But \"run left\" is not a standard verb. Alternatively, maybe \"run\" modified by \"left\" with \"left\" meaning something else. Wait, but according to the rules, the only modifiers are opposite, around, and repetition (twice, thrice). So perhaps \"run left\" is a mistake and should be \"turn left\", but given the input, maybe we have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a typo for \"turn left\", but assuming the input is correct, perhaps \"run left\" is a compound verb. But since the rules don't have that, perhaps we have to interpret it as \"run\" followed by \"left\", but \"left\" isn't a verb. Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" should be \"run\" with direction left, which isn't covered by the rules, so perhaps we need to treat it as a single verb, but since it's not in the primitive list, this would be a problem. Hmm. This seems like a possible error, but since the example works, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the input should be \"run twice after turn around right thrice\", but the user wrote \"run left twice after...\". Alternatively, maybe \"left\" here refers to the direction of the turn. Wait, perhaps \"run left\" is a typo for \"turn left\", but proceeding with the given input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"run left\"", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 60, "model_reflection": "The original interpretation of 'run left' as 'run then turn left' was speculative and not fully grounded in the given rules.

The input is \"jump right thrice and jump opposite left\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part. Starting with \"jump right thrice\". According to rule 4, \"thrice\" means repeat the verb sequence three times. But wait, the structure here is \"jump right\" thrice. So \"jump right\" is the verb and direction. So each repetition would involve turning right and then jumping. But wait, \"jump right\" might be interpreted as jumping to the right, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are mapped. The primitive verbs are jump, turn left, turn right. Hmm, so \"jump right\" might actually be a combination of turning right then jumping? Wait, no. Wait, the rules say that primitive verbs map to actions. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump right\" isn't a primitive verb. So perhaps \"jump\" is the verb, and \"right\" is a direction here. Wait, but how to parse that.\n\nWait, looking at the example given in the problem: \"jump around right\" becomes turning right then jump four times. So \"around right\" is a directive for the verb. So \"jump around right\" is the verb 'jump' modified by 'around right', which according to rule 3 is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So in the example, each time you turn right then jump, four times total.\n\nSo in the current input, \"jump right thrice\" — how does that parse? The user wrote \"jump right\", then \"thrice\". Hmm. The \"right\" here might be part of the verb? But \"jump right\" isn't a primitive verb. So maybe \"jump\" is the verb, and \"right\" is a direction modifier. Wait, but according to the rules, how do modifiers work? Let's see. Rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" means two turns in DIR then the verb. Rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Rule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"jump right\" may not be a standard primitive. Wait, perhaps \"jump right\" is a mistake, but the user input could have \"jump thrice right\"? Or maybe the user wrote \"jump right thrice\" meaning jumping to the right three times. Wait, perhaps the structure here is that \"jump right\" is the verb, but since \"jump right\" isn't a primitive, maybe the direction is attached. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump right\" here should be interpreted as \"jump to the right\", but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are just jump, which would be a single action. But how does direction come into play for the jump? The rules don't specify that. Wait, but looking at the example again: \"jump around right\" uses the turn right. So maybe when direction is given with a verb, it's about turning first. Wait, but the rules have specific modifiers. Let me re-examine the rules.\n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" means two turns in DIR then the verb. So if you have \"jump opposite left\", that would be two turns left (which would be turning left twice, which would face you right?), then jump.\n\nRule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = four times [turn DIR + verb]. So \"jump around right\" would be turn right, jump, four times. Which the example shows as four turns right and four jumps.\n\nRule 4: \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if the command was \"walk twice\", it would be I_WALK I_WALK.\n\nSo, going back to the current problem. The input is \"jump right thrice and jump opposite left\".\n\nBreaking this into two parts: part A is \"jump right thrice\", part B is \"jump opposite left\". Then, according to rule 5, \"A and B\" means A then B.\n\nBut how to parse \"jump right thrice\". The rules don't mention a direct \"verb right\" unless it's a modifier like around or opposite. So maybe \"jump right\" here is intended as \"jump to the right\", but according to the rules, how to parse that? Or perhaps the user made a mistake and meant \"jump thrice right\"? Or maybe \"jump right\" is a verb, but not a primitive. Alternatively, perhaps \"right\" here is part of a modifier. Let's think.\n\nWait, \"jump right thrice\" could be parsed as \"jump [right]\" thrice. But how? Or maybe \"jump right\" is a single action, but not a primitive. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"jump to the right\", which might be equivalent to turning right and then jumping. But according to rule 2, \"opposite left\" would be two left turns then jump. So perhaps direction in the verb implies a turn before the verb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"turn right then jump\". If that's the case, then \"jump right thrice\" would be [turn right then jump] repeated three times? Wait, but rule 4 says \"verb twice\" is repeat twice. So \"jump right\" as a verb plus direction? Hmm, not sure. Wait, but the problem says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\". The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump right\" is not a primitive verb. So \"jump\" is the verb, and \"right\" must be a modifier. How?\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump right\" is not a primitive, so the correct parsing would be \"jump\" modified by \"right\", but according to the rules, only modifiers like \"opposite <DIR>\", \"around <DIR>\", \"twice\", etc. So \"jump right\" doesn't fit into any of these rules. That's a problem. Unless the user made a mistake here.\n\nWait, but the input is given as \"jump right thrice and jump opposite left\". Let's look at the second part first. \"jump opposite left\" would be according to rule 2: opposite <DIR> → two turns in DIR then the verb. So opposite left → two left turns, then jump. So the action sequence would be I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP.\n\nSo the second part is straightforward.\n\nNow the first part: \"jump right thrice\". Since \"jump right\" isn't a primitive verb, but the rules don't specify how to handle directions unless they're in modifiers like around, opposite, or the verb is a turn. Hmm. Wait, perhaps \"jump right\" is a mistake, and the intended meaning is \"jump thrice to the right\" or similar. But according to the given rules, how to parse it?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended \"jump\" to the right, which would be equivalent to \"turn right then jump\". If so, then \"jump right thrice\" would be [turn right, jump] done three times? But according to rule 4, \"verb twice\" means repeat the verb sequence twice. So if the verb sequence is \"turn right then jump\", then repeating that thrice would be three times. But the wording here is \"jump right thrice\". Hmm.\n\nWait, the rule 4 says: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if the verb sequence is \"jump right\", then we need to repeat that twice. But if \"jump right\" is the verb sequence, but according to the primitive verbs, that's not a primitive, so maybe the system is supposed to parse \"jump\" as the verb and \"right\" as a direction modifier. However, the rules don't specify a rule for direction modifiers unless it's part of \"opposite\", \"around\", or a turn verb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump right\" is a misinterpretation, and the correct parsing is \"jump\" followed by \"right\", which would be a direction. But since \"right\" alone isn't a verb, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake, but we have to work with the given input.\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump right\" here is intended to be \"turn right\" followed by \"jump\". Then \"jump right thrice\" would be [turn right, jump] thrice. But how would that fit into the rules?\n\nRule 4 says that if a verb is followed by \"twice\" or \"thrice\", you repeat the verb sequence. So if the verb sequence is \"jump right\", which itself may not be a standard verb, but if the system interprets \"jump right\" as a single action, then thrice would repeat it. But according to the rules, only the primitive verbs are allowed, so this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump right thrice\" is parsed as \"jump\" modified by \"right thrice\", but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is a direction, but according to the rules, the only way to use direction modifiers is with around, opposite, etc. So perhaps \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"turn right then jump\", and \"jump right thrice\" is equivalent to \"jump after turn right\" done three times. But how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and meant \"turn right then jump thrice\", but given that the input is as is, we have to parse it. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at the example:\n\nIN: jump around right → OUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated 4 times (each time turn right then jump, total four times). So the \"around right\" applies to the jump, following rule 3.\n\nSimilarly, \"jump opposite left\"", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 90, "model_reflection": "The initial answer correctly breaks down the command using the given rules.

The input is \"turn right after turn around right twice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the structure. According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So here, \"turn right\" is A, and \"turn around right twice\" is B. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original command is \"turn right after turn around right twice\". So the structure is \"A after B\", where A is \"turn right\" and B is \"turn around right twice\". But according to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So the entire sequence would be B followed by A.\n\nBut let's parse each part. Let's start with B: \"turn around right twice\". \n\nBreaking down B: \"around right\" means 4 repetitions of [turn right + verb]. But the verb here is \"turn\", so each repetition would be \"turn right then turn\". Wait, but \"turn\" here is the verb. Wait, the primitive verbs are mapped to actions. The verb here is \"turn right\" in the first part. Wait, wait, the command is \"turn around right twice\". Hmm.\n\nWait, \"around <DIR>\" is defined as 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. The verb here is \"turn\". Wait, but the original part is \"turn around right twice\". So \"around right\" applies to the verb \"turn\". So \"turn around right\" would be 4 repetitions of [turn right then turn]. Then \"twice\" would mean repeating that entire sequence twice.\n\nWait, so \"turn around right\" would be:\n\nFor each of the 4 repetitions:\n- turn right, then turn (right? Or is \"turn\" the action, but the verb here is \"turn\", which maps to I_TURN_RIGHT or I_TURN_LEFT. Wait, the primitive verbs are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\", which map to I_TURN_LEFT and I_TURN_RIGHT. So in the command \"turn around right\", the verb is \"turn right\", because \"around right\" is the direction. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is \"verb around DIR\". So \"turn around right\" would be the verb \"turn\" around right. Wait, but according to the rules, \"around <DIR>\" applies to the verb. So \"around <DIR>\" after a verb means that the verb is preceded by a turn in that direction, repeated four times.\n\nWait, the original rule says: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So regardless of the verb, each repetition is a turn in DIR direction followed by the verb. So if the verb is \"turn left\", then each repetition would be turn DIR (right, in the example), then turn left. Wait, but in this case, the verb here is \"turn right\"? Or is the verb \"turn\" in the command \"turn around right\"?\n\nWait, the command is \"turn around right twice\". Let's parse this. \"around right\" is the direction for the around, so the verb here is \"turn\". Wait, but \"turn\" alone isn't a primitive verb. The primitive verbs are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". So perhaps \"turn\" here is not a valid primitive verb. But in the example, \"jump around right\" expands to four jumps with turns. So in that case, the verb is \"jump\", and \"around right\" applies to it. So in the current problem, the command \"turn around right\" would be using \"turn\" as the verb. But according to the rules, the primitive verbs are the ones that map to uppercase actions. However, \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are the only turn-related primitive verbs. So \"turn\" by itself isn't a primitive verb. Hmm. This might be a problem. But perhaps in the command \"turn around right\", the verb is \"turn right\" ?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me re-examine the problem. The command is \"turn around right twice\". Let's parse this. The \"around right\" part would apply to the verb. The verb here must be a primitive verb. The possible primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So in this case, the verb might be \"turn right\", but the way the command is structured, \"turn around right twice\" could be parsed as \"turn (as a verb) around right, twice\". But \"turn\" alone isn't a primitive verb. Alternatively, maybe \"turn around\" is considered a verb, but according to the rules, it's not in the list. Hmm. This is confusing. Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps the command is \"turn right after turn around right twice\". Let's parse the entire command. Let's split into parts:\n\nOriginal command: \"turn right after turn around right twice\"\n\nBreaking this into \"A after B\", where A is \"turn right\" and B is \"turn around right twice\". Then according to rule 6, we do B followed by A. So first, process B, then process A.\n\nNow, processing B: \"turn around right twice\". The \"around right\" part applies to the verb \"turn\". Wait, but \"turn\" isn't a valid primitive verb unless it's either \"turn left\" or \"turn right\". Therefore, perhaps the verb here is \"turn right\", and the structure is \"around right\" applies to the verb. Wait, but that would be redundant. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the command \"turn around right\" would be parsed as follows: the main verb is \"turn\" but that's not allowed. Alternatively, maybe \"turn around right\" is equivalent to \"turn right around right\"? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the verb here is \"turn right\", and \"around right\" is applied to it. Wait, that's probably not right.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that \"turn around right\" is a compound verb. But according to the rules, \"around <DIR>\" applies to the verb. So the structure would be \"around right\" modifying the verb \"turn\". But \"turn\" alone isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the verb here is \"turn right\", and the \"around right\" is in addition. But I'm stuck.\n\nWait, let's look at the example again. The example input is \"jump around right\" and the output is four jumps with turns. So the \"around\" applies to the jump. So each repetition is a turn right, then jump. So the \"around\" adds a turn in the direction, then the verb. So in general, for any verb, even if it's \"turn left\", perhaps. So in this problem, the verb in \"turn around right twice\" would be \"turn\". But \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, perhaps the command is invalid. However, given that the user provided this input, we have to parse it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"turn around right\" is parsed as \"turn right\" being the verb, and \"around right\" would be modifying that verb. But that doesn't fit the rules. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the input \"turn around right\" should be parsed as \"around right\" modifying the verb \"turn\". Which verb? But \"turn\" isn't a valid primitive verb. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe \"turn around right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\" as the verb, and \"around\" is applied. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the verb is \"turn around right\", but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are only the ones listed. So perhaps the user made a mistake. But given that this is the input, we need to handle it.\n\nWait, maybe the verb here is \"turn\" as in \"turn left or turn right\", but in this case, the direction is modified by \"around right twice\". Alternatively, perhaps the \"turn\" in \"turn around right\" refers to turning right. Let's assume that the verb here is \"turn right\", then \"around right\" would be applied to it. Wait, that would be conflicting. Because \"around right\" would take the verb (turn right), and do [turn right, then verb], four times. Wait, but if the verb is \"turn right\", then each step would be: turn right, then turn right. Then repeat this four times, then do that twice because of \"twice\".\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nProcessing B: \"turn around right twice\".\n\nBreaking this down: the core verb is \"turn\", but with \"around right\" around it. But according to the rules, \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. The verb here would be the original verb. So the original verb must be a primitive verb. Let's assume that the verb here is \"turn right\", but that's unclear.\n\nWait, no. The command is \"turn around right twice\". Let's parse \"turn\" as the verb. But according to the rules, \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb. So maybe this is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the verb is \"turn right\", and \"around\" applies. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the command is ambiguous. But given the rules, perhaps the correct approach is to parse \"around right\" as modifying the verb that precedes it. The verb in this case would be \"turn right\" or \"turn left\", but the input is \"turn around right twice\". So maybe \"turn\" is the verb, but that's invalid. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"turn around right\" is a way to say \"turn right around right\", which could be a way to say \"turn right around right\", but that's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 45, "model_reflection": "Upon re-evaluation, the initial parsing of 'turn around right twice' was incorrect.

Hmm. But given that the problem is presented as is, I need to work with what's given. Let's proceed by assuming that \"look opposite left\" is supposed to be \"turn opposite left\", which would be a valid verb. Because \"turn left\" is a primitive verb.

But that would leave \"opposite left\" without a verb. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is \"look opposite left after run right thrice\". Let's parse this as \"run right thrice\" is the first part, then \"look opposite left\" is after. But if \"look\" isn't a valid verb, then the \"look opposite left\" part would be invalid. Hmm, but the problem expects an output. Maybe the \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\", or another verb. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is supposed to be \"turn left\", but the user made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is intended to be a verb that's not in the primitive list. But according to the rules, only the listed verbs are mapped. Therefore, \"look\" is invalid.

But the input is \"look opposite left after run right thrice\". Let's split into parts. The main clause is \"look opposite left after run right thrice\".

So \"look opposite left\" after \"run right thrice\" → do \"run right thrice\" first, then \"look opposite left\".\n\nBut \"look opposite left\" would be the structure. Now, if \"look\" isn't a verb, then this is invalid. But given that the problem gives this input, perhaps \"look\" is a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user intended \"look\" to be \"walk\", or \"turn left\". Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is supposed to be a verb that maps to an action, but according to the rules, it's not. Therefore, perhaps \"look\" is ignored, but then \"opposite left\" requires a verb. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\" or another verb.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended \"look\" as a verb and expects it to be mapped to an action, but according to the given rules, it's not.

Alternatively, perhaps \"look opposite left\" is a mistake, but we need to proceed. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is intended as a verb that's not in the list, which would mean that the semantic parsing agent would ignore it or have no action for it, but according to the problem's example, invalid commands aren't considered. So perhaps \"look\" is a mistake, and the correct input would have a valid verb. However, given that this is a problem to solve, perhaps we can proceed by assuming that \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\", but that's a big assumption. Alternatively, maybe the \"look\" is supposed to be \"turn left\", which would make sense with \"opposite left\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"look\" is a red herring, and the actual verb is missing, but the rest can be parsed. But that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe \"look opposite left\" is supposed to be parsed as \"turn left opposite\", which would be \"turn right twice then turn left\", per rule 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the input, and \"look\" should be \"turn left\". Alternatively, perhaps the input is correct, and the agent should output the actions for \"run right thrice\" followed by \"look opposite left\", but the \"look opposite left\" can't be processed. But since the user expects an answer, perhaps the \"look\" is a typo for a valid verb. Let's try to proceed assuming that \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\", or perhaps that it's a mistake and the correct verb is \"turn left\", but that's not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that \"look opposite left\" is parsed as follows: \"look\" is a verb that doesn't have a corresponding action, but according to the rules, we can only process the listed verbs. Therefore, perhaps \"look opposite left\" is invalid, and the output would be from \"run right thrice\" only. But the user example shows that the entire command is processed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"look\" is a mistake, and the correct structure is \"turn opposite left\". But \"turn\" is part of the primitive verbs as \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". So \"turn\" is part of the primitive verbs. But \"turn opposite left\" would be \"opposite left\" direction. Wait, perhaps the original command should be \"walk opposite left after run right thrice\". But given that it's written as \"look opposite left\", perhaps the answer is missing some parts.\n\nHmm. This is a bit of a puzzle. Let's try to proceed step by step.\n\nOriginal command: \"look opposite left after run right thrice\"\n\nSplit into parts:\n\nRule 6: A after B = B then A.\n\nSo here, \"look opposite left\" after \"run right thrice\" → do \"run right thrice\" first, then \"look opposite left\".\n\nNow, parse \"run right thrice\". Rule 4: \"thrice\" means repeat thrice. So \"run right\" is a verb and direction. \"run\" is a primitive verb. So \"run right\" would be I_RUN followed by turning right? No, wait: wait, no. Wait, according to the rules, \"Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions: walk→I_WALK, run→I_RUN, jump→I_JUMP, turn left→I_TURN_LEFT, turn right→I_TURN_RIGHT.\" So each primitive verb maps to its own action. So \"run right\" would be a compound, but according to the rules, \"run\" is a verb and \"right\" is a direction. Wait, but \"run\" is a primitive verb. \"run right\" isn't a standard primitive. Wait, perhaps the \"right\" here is part of the verb, like \"turn right\" is a primitive. But \"run right\" would be a direction to run in. But according to the rules, \"run\" is a verb that doesn't have a direction. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the example: IN: jump around right → OUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times. So \"jump\" is the verb, and \"around right\" is the modifier. So direction words like \"right\" in \"around right\" are part of the modifier.", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 65, "model_reflection": "The original response treated 'look opposite left' as invalid because 'look' is not a primitive verb.

The input is \"walk opposite left thrice and run around left\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part according to the rules. Let's start with \"walk opposite left thrice\". \n\nThe structure here is \"walk opposite left\" modified by \"thrice\". According to rule 2, \"opposite left\" means two turns in the left direction. So \"opposite left\" translates to two I_TURN_LEFT actions. Then the verb \"walk\" follows each turn. Wait, no, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, actually, rule 2 states: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, the wording here might mean that after two turns in the DIR direction, you perform the verb. Wait, the example for \"opposite left\" would be turning left twice (since opposite left would be turning left twice to face the opposite direction?), then do the verb. Wait, but the rule says \"two turns in DIR then the verb\". Hmm, maybe \"opposite left\" means that to go opposite left, you have to turn left twice, then do the verb. But wait, that might not make sense. Wait, maybe the \"opposite left\" is equivalent to turning 180 degrees left, which would be two left turns. Then the verb.\n\nWait, but the rule says \"opposite <DIR>\" is equivalent to two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, the wording is ambiguous. Let me re-read the rules. \n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, perhaps the \"opposite\" of a direction DIR is two turns in that direction, then the verb. Wait, maybe that's not right. Wait, maybe \"opposite <DIR>\" means that you have to turn two times in DIR, then perform the action. So if the command is \"walk opposite left\", then it would be two left turns (to face the opposite direction), then walk. Wait, but that would be two I_TURN_LEFT actions followed by I_WALK. But according to the rules, \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. So the verb is the action. So \"walk opposite left\" would be parsed as two turns left, then walk. So the action sequence would be I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK. \n\nThen \"thrice\" applies to that entire verb sequence. Rule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice; similarly for thrice. Wait, the \"verb\" here refers to the entire action, which might include modifiers. So \"walk opposite left thrice\" means that the \"walk opposite left\" action is repeated three times. So first parse the \"walk opposite left\" into its components, then repeat that three times. \n\nSo \"walk opposite left\" is two left turns plus a walk. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeat that entire sequence three times. So each repetition would be two I_TURN_LEFT, I_WALK, and that's done three times. So the first part would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK repeated three times. \n\nWait, but wait: \"opposite left\" is two turns left then the verb. So the verb is the action. So the \"walk opposite left\" would be equivalent to doing two turns left, then walk. So each time you do that, it's two turns left then walk. Then \"thrice\" would mean doing that three times. So the sequence would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK\n\nBut wait, that's three times. Each \"walk opposite left\" is two turns left plus walk, repeated three times. But the \"thrice\" applies to the verb sequence. Wait, rule 4 says that \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"walk opposite left\" is the verb sequence here. So \"walk opposite left thrice\" would be the sequence for \"walk opposite left\" repeated three times. Which would be each \"walk opposite left\" translated to two turns left, then walk. So three times that sequence.\n\nSo the first part is three times (turn left, turn left, walk). Then the next part is \"run around left\". According to rule 3: \"around left\" = 4 repetitions of [turn left + run]. Wait, the rule says around DIR is four repetitions of turn DIR plus verb. So for \"run around left\", the verb is run. So each repetition is turn left, then run. And this is done four times. So the sequence would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\n\nNow, the entire command is \"walk opposite left thrice AND run around left\". Rule 5: \"A and B\" = do A then B. So the entire action sequence is first the processing of \"walk opposite left thrice\" (which is three times two turns left and walk) followed by processing \"run around left\" (which is four times turn left and run).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFirst part (walk opposite left thrice):\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK (repeated 3 times)\nSo:\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK\n\nSecond part (run around left):\n\n[ I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN ] repeated 4 times:\nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\n\nCombined, the entire sequence is:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\n\nWait, but wait, the command is \"walk opposite left thrice and run around left\". So according to rule 5, A and B is A followed by B. So the first part (walk opposite left thrice) is A, then B is run around left. So the order is correct.\n\nNow, check for any possible mistakes. Let's re-express each part.\n\nFor \"walk opposite left thrice\": \n\nopposite left is two turns left, then walk. So each walk opposite left is two left turns then walk. Then thrice would repeat that entire action three times. So yes, each sequence is two left turns, walk, done three times. So the first part is 3x (turn left, turn left, walk). \n\nFor \"run around left\": \n\naround left means four times [turn left + run]. So each turn left followed by run, four times. So the second part is four times (turn left, run). \n\nPutting all together, the final output should be the first part sequences followed by the second part sequences.\n\nSo the action sequence:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK repeated three times:\n\nFirst repetition: I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK\n\nSecond: I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK\n\nThird: I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK\n\nThen run around left: four times I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\n\nWhich gives:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN repeated four times.\n\nSo the total output is:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\n\nI should check if there's any other possible interpretations. For example, could \"opposite left thrice\" be interpreted differently? Like, maybe opposite left is a direction, and then thrice applies to the walk? But according to the rules, \"opposite <DIR>\" is rule 2, and \"verb thrice\" is rule 4. So \"walk opposite left\" is a verb modified by opposite left. Then \"thrice\" applies to that verb sequence. So the original parsing is correct.\n\nAnother check: in the example given, \"jump around right\" becomes four repetitions of turn right and jump, which is four times I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP, with spaces. So the example output is exactly that. So the same logic applies here. So yes, \"run around left\" is four times I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN.\n\nSo the final output should be the concatenation of the first and second parts as described.", "rationality_label": "Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The original command 'walk opposite left thrice and run around left' is parsed as follows: 'opposite left' means turning left twice (180-degree turn), then 'walk' once.

So \"opposite right\" would be two turns right, which translates to I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nNow, the first part of the command is \"look opposite right thrice\". Wait, \"look\" isn't in the list of primitive verbs. The rules map verbs like walk, run, jump, turn left/right. Hmm, maybe \"look\" is a verb that's equivalent to a turn? Or is it a different action? The problem statement doesn't mention \"look\" in the primitive verbs list. But in the example, \"jump around right\" uses I_JUMP, so maybe \"look\" here is considered a separate action. Wait, but the rules only specify certain verbs. The user might have intended \"look\" to be a turn action. Or perhaps \"look\" is a typo for \"turn\"? Let me check again.\n\nThe original example uses \"jump around right\" which becomes 4 repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So \"jump\" is a verb. The input here has \"look opposite right thrice\". Since \"look\" isn't in the primitive list, but \"turn\" is. Maybe \"look\" in this context is equivalent to a turn. Or perhaps the problem expects that \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, but the problem says \"semantic parsing agent for navigation commands\" and the rules mention primitive verbs. So maybe \"look\" is not a primitive verb. Is there a mistake here, or am I missing something?\n\nWait, the example uses \"jump around right\" which maps to turn right then jump four times. So the structure is that \"around <DIR>\" applies to the verb. So \"look\" would be a verb here. But according to the first rule, primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Wait, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. But \"turn\" is a verb, but \"look\" isn't listed. Hmm. This is a problem. The input includes \"look\", which isn't in the primitive verbs. So either this is a mistake, or maybe \"look\" is supposed to be treated as a verb. But according to the rules, only the listed verbs are mapped. Wait, perhaps \"look\" is not a primitive verb, so maybe the user intended \"turn\" instead?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"turn left\" or something else. But the problem's input is given as such. Let me proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a verb that's allowed here, but according to the rules, it's not a primitive. Wait, that doesn't make sense. The problem might have an error. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is equivalent to a turn action. For the sake of solving this, maybe the user intended \"look\" to be a turn. Or perhaps \"look\" is a different action not covered by the current rules. But since the example includes \"turn left\" as a primitive verb, but \"look\" isn't here, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe \"look\" here is a mistake, and the intended verb was \"turn\". Let me re-read the input. The input is \"look opposite right thrice and turn opposite right\". The first part is \"look opposite right thrice\". If \"look\" is a typo for \"turn\", then it would make sense. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a different verb, but since the rules don't mention it, I might need to ignore that part or assume it's invalid. However, this is a test case, so I should proceed. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is equivalent to \"turn\", as in looking in a direction. Let's proceed with that assumption. But the example uses \"jump\" as a verb. So perhaps \"look\" is a separate verb. Wait, the problem says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\", but \"look\" is not listed. So this seems like a problem. Maybe the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is part of the language but not a primitive verb. Hmm. Wait, perhaps \"look\" is not a primitive verb, but part of some other rule. Let's see.\n\nWait, the input has \"turn opposite right\" which is a valid part. So \"turn\" is a primitive verb. So \"turn opposite right\" would be the verb \"turn\", so according to rule 2, \"opposite right\" would be two turns right. So \"turn opposite right\" would be two instances of turning right. Wait, the verb is \"turn\", and the direction is \"opposite right\". Wait, but \"turn opposite right\" would be the same as turning right twice (as per rule 2: opposite <DIR> is two turns in DIR). So \"turn opposite right\" would be equivalent to two right turns, which would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nBut then the first part is \"look opposite right thrice\". If \"look\" is a verb, but not a primitive, then how do we handle it? This is confusing. Wait, maybe the problem intended \"look\" to be a typo for \"walk\" or \"run\", but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a primitive verb not listed here, but according to the rules, it's not included, which would make the parser unable to handle it. But given that the user provided this input, there must be a way. Wait, perhaps \"look\" is a verb that's not a primitive, but modified by the rules. Wait, looking back at the rules:\n\nRule 1 says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\". The examples given are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn\" is a verb but when direction is given as left or right. So \"turn left\" is I_TURN_LEFT. So \"look\" isn't in the list. Therefore, perhaps \"look\" is invalid. But the problem gives this input, so perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is considered a primitive verb that maps to a different action, like I_LOOK, but since the example doesn't mention that, it's unclear. This might be a test of how to handle unknown verbs. However, the problem statement says \"semantic parsing agent for navigation commands\" following those rules. So maybe the input is invalid. But the user expects us to process it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a typo, and the correct verb is \"turn\". Let's suppose that. Then the input would be \"turn opposite right thrice and turn opposite right\". Let's process that. But the original input is \"look\", so maybe I should proceed. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that \"look\" is equivalent to \"turn\", so \"look opposite right\" would be \"turn opposite right\", which would be two turns right, then \"thrice\" would apply to that action. Wait, but \"look opposite right thrice\" would be \"look opposite right\" done thrice. But if \"look\" is a verb, then according to the rules, how is it handled?\n\nThis is a problem. Since the user provided this input, perhaps the answer should be based on assuming that \"look\" is a primitive verb. But according to the rules, it's not. Therefore, this seems like an inconsistency. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is part of a different structure. Wait, perhaps \"look\" is a verb that doesn't have a direction, but modified by \"opposite right\". For example, \"look\" in the opposite right direction. But according to the rules, how would that be parsed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a verb that requires a direction, so \"look opposite right\" would be equivalent to \"turn opposite right\", but the problem is that the rules don't specify the mapping for \"look\". Therefore, this input is invalid, but since the problem expects an answer, maybe the assistant should proceed with the assumption that \"look\" maps to a movement verb, perhaps similar to \"turn\". Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a mistake. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a verb that doesn't have a direction, but in the input, the direction is given. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to handle this, so \"look opposite right thrice\" would be parsed as:\n\nThe verb is \"look opposite right\", but \"opposite right\" is a direction modifier. But according to the rules, \"opposite <DIR>\" modifies the verb. Wait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"look opposite right\" would be two turns right, then the verb \"look\". But \"look\" would need to be a primitive verb. However, the problem's rules don't list \"look\" as a primitive verb. Therefore, this is an issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"look\" here is a mistake, and the intended verb was \"walk\" or \"jump\". But without more information, it's hard to say. However, given that the user provided this input, I must proceed. Perhaps the answer should treat \"look\" as a verb that maps to an action, even though it's not listed. For example, if \"look\" maps to I_LOOK. Similarly, \"turn\" maps to I_TURN. But the example given uses \"jump\" which maps to I_JUMP. Therefore, if we assume that \"look\" is a valid primitive verb, then:\n\n\"look opposite right\" would be two turns right (from rule 2) then the verb \"look\", so I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK.\n\nThen \"th", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The original command 'look opposite right thrice and turn opposite right' is parsed according to the rules as follows: 'opposite right' means two right turns.

The \"opposite right\" part means two turns to the right, then the verb. So opposite right would be two I_TURN_RIGHT actions followed by the verb, which is run here. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the rule says \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, wait. Wait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb.

Wait, but in the example given, \"jump around right\" becomes four times [turn right, jump], so four turns and four jumps. So each around is four repetitions. So the structure of each rule.\n\nNow, back to the current problem. The command is \"run opposite right twice and run\".\n\nLet me parse each part. The command is structured as \"A and run\", where A is \"run opposite right twice\". According to rule 5, \"A and B\" means A followed by B. So first do A, then do run.\n\nNow, A is \"run opposite right twice\". Wait, the \"twice\" applies to the previous part. Let's parse \"run opposite right twice\". Hmm, but how? Wait, the phrase \"run opposite right twice\" could be interpreted as \"run opposite right\" done twice? Or is \"opposite right\" the direction for run, and then \"twice\" applies to the entire action?\n\nWait, let's look at rule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. Similarly for thrice. But what's the sequence here?\n\nWait, \"run opposite right twice\" – \"opposite right\" is a modifier for the verb run. So first, we have the verb \"run\", modified by \"opposite right\", and then the entire thing is repeated twice.\n\nWait, but how to parse \"run opposite right twice\". Let's break it down:\n\n- The core verb is \"run\".\n\n- The modifier \"opposite right\" applies to the verb, meaning that each occurrence of the verb would be preceded by two turns right.\n\nWait, no. According to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" means that the verb becomes two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"run opposite right\" would be two turns right followed by run. Wait, no. Wait, rule 2 says that \"opposite <DIR>\" is equivalent to the verb. So the entire verb sequence is replaced by two turns in DIR direction followed by the verb.\n\nWait, no. Let me read rule 2 again. Rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"opposite <DIR>\" replaces the verb. For example, if the command is \"jump opposite left\", then it's two left turns, then jump.\n\nWait, so in the example given, the input \"jump around right\" becomes four repetitions of [turn right, jump], ending up with four turns and four jumps. So \"around\" involves alternating turn and verb four times.\n\nSo in \"run opposite right twice and run\", the first part is \"run opposite right twice\". Let's parse \"run opposite right\" first. According to rule 2, \"opposite right\" converts to two I_TURN_RIGHT and then the verb. Wait, no: the verb is \"run\", but \"opposite right\" is a modifier on the verb. So the entire verb becomes \"opposite right run\"? Wait, no. Wait, the way the rule is phrased: \"opposite <DIR>\" is equal to two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, perhaps \"opposite <DIR>\" is a verb itself. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding this.\n\nWait, the rule says: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So if the command has \"opposite left\", that would be equivalent to two left turns, then the verb. Wait, but what is the verb here? Wait, perhaps the structure is that when you have a verb followed by \"opposite <DIR>\", you replace that verb with two turns in DIR and then the verb. Or is \"opposite <DIR>\" acting as a directional modifier for the verb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"opposite <DIR>\" is a verb. Wait, the example in the problem says \"jump around right\" becomes a sequence of four turn right and jumps, so \"around\" is a modifier for the verb. So perhaps modifiers like \"around\", \"opposite\", etc., affect how the verb is executed.\n\nLet me re-express the rules with examples.\n\nRule 1: Primitive verbs map directly to actions. So \"walk\" is I_WALK, etc.\n\nRule 2: If a verb has \"opposite <DIR>\", then the action is two turns in DIR direction followed by the verb. Wait, perhaps the structure is that \"opposite <DIR>\" modifies the verb. So \"run opposite left\" would mean run in the opposite left direction, which would be achieved by turning left twice (to face opposite direction) then run.\n\nBut how to parse \"run opposite right twice\". Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps \"run opposite right\" is the verb and modifier. So \"run\" modified by \"opposite right\". Which would be two right turns then run. So the action sequence for \"run opposite right\" would be two turns right, then run. But according to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. So the entire verb is replaced by two turns and the verb. Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, if the command is \"run opposite right\", then according to rule 2, \"opposite right\" would be replaced by two turns right, then the verb run. So the action sequence would be two turns right, then run. So the verb is run, but the \"opposite right\" is replacing the verb with two turns and then the verb? No, that seems confusing.\n\nWait, the wording of rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"opposite <DIR>\" is a command that equals two turns, then the verb. But how is this used? For example, if the input is \"walk opposite left\", then the output would be two left turns, then walk. So the entire command is \"opposite left\" followed by the verb? Or is \"opposite left\" a way to modify the verb. Maybe the input would be phrased as \"opposite left, walk\" or similar. But in the problem's example, the input is \"jump around right\", which uses a modifier. So perhaps the structure is that modifiers like \"around\" or \"opposite\" come after the verb. Then \"run opposite right\" would be the verb \"run\" modified by \"opposite right\", which would translate to two right turns then run. But according to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" is the same as two turns DIR then the verb. So \"opposite right\" would be two right turns then the verb. Wait, but then what is the verb here? Or is \"opposite <DIR>\" a verb itself? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"opposite <DIR>\" is a way of modifying the direction before performing the verb. So \"run opposite right\" would mean turn around (by two turns) and run. So two right turns, then run. That seems plausible.\n\nSo for \"run opposite right twice\", the \"run opposite right\" is done twice. But wait, rule 4 says that <verb> twice is repeat the verb sequence twice. So if the verb is modified by opposite, then each repetition would be the modified verb.\n\nWait, but \"run opposite right twice\" would parse as: the verb is \"run\", modified by \"opposite right\". Then \"twice\" applies to that verb. So each repetition would be two right turns followed by run. And since it's done twice, then the entire sequence would be (two right turns, run) repeated twice.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nFirst part: run opposite right twice → each run becomes two right turns then run. And this is done twice. So each instance is two turns and a run. So for two times:\n\nFirst iteration: I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_RUN\n\nSecond iteration: I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_RUN\n\nSo the first part would be: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN\n\nThen \"and run\" → do the first part then run. So after the above, add another I_RUN.\n\nWait, but wait. Rule 4: <verb> twice = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if the verb is modified by opposite, then the entire modified verb is repeated. So the modified verb is two turns and the verb (run).

The example given uses \"jump around right\" which is a combination of turn and jump. So maybe \"look right\" is not a primitive verb. Wait, the original problem might have a typo or perhaps \"look right\" is a command. Wait, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are only walk, run, jump, turn left/right.

The user might have intended \"look right\" as a command, but according to the rules, the available verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left/right. So perhaps \"look right\" is not a valid primitive. But maybe \"look right\" here is a typo and should be \"turn right\". Or maybe the system allows other verbs. Wait, the example uses \"jump around right\", which is allowed. Hmm. The problem states that the agent is for navigation commands, so maybe \"look\" is not a valid action. But the input includes \"look right\", which I have to parse. Wait, the rules are given in the problem statement, and the user's input must be processed according to those rules. The rules don't mention \"look\" as a primitive verb. Therefore, perhaps \"look right\" is not a valid command, but the problem expects us to process it. Wait, maybe the problem expects that \"look right\" is treated as \"turn right\"? Or maybe \"look right\" is a verb that's not listed. But the problem says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\" and lists only walk, run, jump, turn left/right. So \"look right\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake, but since it's given as input, I need to process it. Wait, but how? The example uses \"jump around right\", which is parsed into turns and jumps. So maybe \"look right\" is a verb that's not part of the primitives. But in that case, the agent should not recognize it. But the problem says to process the command as given. Hmm. Wait, maybe \"look right\" here is a mistake, and the intended command is \"turn right\". Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is a separate action. However, according to the problem's rules, it's not. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the validity and parse according to the given structure. But the problem says \"You are a semantic parsing agent for navigation commands.\" So perhaps \"look right\" is part of the command. Wait, but according to the rules, only the primitive verbs listed are valid. Therefore, \"look right\" is not a valid verb. So how to handle this? Maybe it's a mistake in the input, but the agent should process it regardless. Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows other verbs, but the agent would not have an action for them. But the example shows that \"jump\" is used. Hmm. Maybe the problem has a typo, and \"look right\" should be \"turn right\". But since the input is given as such, I must process it. Wait, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left/right. Therefore, \"look right\" is not a primitive verb. Therefore, perhaps \"look right\" is a mistake, but the user intended \"turn right\". Let's proceed under that assumption, because otherwise the command is invalid. Alternatively, maybe \"look right\" is a typo for \"turn left\". Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is a command that's equivalent to turning right. Because when you look right, you might turn your head, but in navigation, maybe it's equivalent to turning right. But the rules don't specify that. So perhaps the correct approach is to treat \"look right\" as a command, but since it's not a primitive verb, it's not mapped. However, the problem expects an output. Therefore, perhaps the problem intended \"look right\" to be a typo and should be \"turn right\". Alternatively, maybe \"look right\" is part of the grammar but not a primitive verb. But then how to parse it. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects that \"look right\" is treated as a verb phrase, but since there's no mapping, it's an error. But given that the user provided this input, maybe I should proceed. Wait, perhaps \"look right\" is the verb. But since the rules say primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left/right. So \"look right\" isn't in the list. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a mistake, but assuming that \"look right\" is supposed to be a valid command. Alternatively, maybe \"look right\" is a compound command. But I don't think so. This is a problem. Let's check the example again. The example input is \"jump around right\", which uses \"jump\" as the verb. So in this problem, the verbs are as listed. Therefore, \"look\" is not a primitive verb. Therefore, perhaps \"look right\" is a mistake. However, given that the problem is presented as such, maybe we proceed with the assumption that \"look right\" is intended to be a valid action, even if not in the list. Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\". Let's proceed under that assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended \"look right\" as a separate action. But since there's no mapping, perhaps it's treated as a no-op. But that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the fact that \"look\" isn't a primitive and just process the structure. For example, maybe \"look right\" is treated as a verb, even if not in the list, and the output would be I_LOOK_RIGHT. But according to the rules, that's not the case. Therefore, perhaps the problem is designed with a typo, and \"look right\" should be \"turn right\". Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake. But since we have to process the given input, perhaps we can proceed with the structure regardless. Let's try to parse the structure of \"turn around right thrice after look right\". So regardless of the specific verb, the structure is that we have to do B then A, where B is \"look right\" and A is \"turn around right thrice\".\n\nAssuming \"look right\" is a valid action, then B would be I_LOOK_RIGHT. But according to the rules, there's no such action. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is a typo for \"turn right\". If that's the case, then B would be I_TURN_RIGHT. Then A is \"turn around right thrice\". Let's parse A: \"turn around right\" is rule 3, which is 4 repetitions of [turn right + verb]. The verb here is \"turn\", so the action would be I_TURN_RIGHT. Wait, but \"turn around right\" would be turning right four times while doing the verb. Wait, according to rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. The verb here would be \"turn\", but wait. Wait, the command is \"turn around right\", which would be the verb \"turn\" plus \"around right\". So applying rule 3: the verb is \"turn\", and around right would be four times [turn right then turn]. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because the verb here is \"turn left/right\". Wait, let's clarify. The structure for \"around\" is: verb around DIR. So \"jump around right\" becomes four times [turn right then jump]. Similarly, \"turn around right\" would be the verb \"turn\", so each repetition would be [turn right then turn]. But \"turn\" alone is a verb, which maps to I_TURN. But according to the rules, the primitive verbs are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\", which map to I_TURN_LEFT and I_TURN_RIGHT. Wait, rule 1 says \"turn left→I_TURN_LEFT, turn right→I_TURN_RIGHT\". So \"turn\" alone is not a primitive verb. The primitive verbs are specifically \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". Therefore, the command \"turn around right\" would be verb \"turn\" (but wait, the only verbs are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\"). Wait, this is a problem. Because \"turn\" alone isn't a primitive verb. So \"turn around right\" is a command, but \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb. The primitive verbs are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". So perhaps \"turn around right\" is invalid, but the input is given as such. Hmm. This complicates things. Let's re-examine the example:\n\nIN: jump around right\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, the output is four turns and four jumps, right?

The phrase \"around <DIR>\" is rule 3, which requires 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. But wait, the verb here is \"look\", but the rules mention \"verb\" in the mappings. However, looking at the primitive verbs list, \"look\" isn't listed. The primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left/right. Hmm, maybe \"look\" isn't a valid primitive here. Wait, the user might have made a mistake, but according to the problem statement, I should process according to the given rules. Let me check the rules again.\n\nRule 1 lists the primitives as walk, run, jump, turn left/right. So \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. But the input has \"look around left twice\", which is part of the command. How to handle that? Wait, maybe \"look\" is a typo, but assuming the input is correct, perhaps \"look\" is a non-primitive verb. But according to the rules, only the primitives are mapped. Wait, this is a problem. Wait, the example given in the problem uses \"jump around right\" which translates to turning right and jumping four times. So \"jump\" is a valid verb. But in the input, the user wrote \"look\". Since the rules don't map \"look\" to any action, maybe it's an error. But the problem says to process the command, so perhaps \"look\" is supposed to be treated as a verb. Wait, but the rules don't mention other verbs. Maybe \"look\" is a mistake, but the assistant should proceed regardless. Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that \"look\" isn't a valid action. But that would complicate things. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\" or \"turn left\", but I can't assume that. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to include \"look\" as a possible verb. Let me check the rules again. The first rule says \"Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions: walk→I_WALK, run→I_RUN, jump→I_JUMP, turn left→I_TURN_LEFT, turn right→I_TURN_RIGHT.\" So only those verbs. Therefore, \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. How to parse this then? The input command includes \"look around left twice\", which under rule 3 would require a verb. But if \"look\" isn't a valid verb, then this is invalid. But the user provided this input, so maybe there's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" here is a typo for \"jump\" or another verb. However, the assistant is supposed to process the given command. \n\nWait, maybe \"look\" here is meant to be ignored, but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that \"look\" is part of a different structure. Wait, perhaps \"look around left\" is the phrase. Wait, \"around left\" would be a direction. Wait, \"look around left\" would be parsed as \"around left\" modifying the verb \"look\". But according to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" applies to the verb. So \"look around left\" would mean to perform the verb \"look\" in the context of \"around left\". But since \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, how do we handle it?\n\nThis seems like a problem. But since the example uses \"jump around right\" and that works, perhaps the input here uses \"look\" which isn't a valid verb. However, the problem expects us to process it. Maybe the user intended \"look\" to be a verb, but it's not in the rules. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\" or another verb. But given that the problem gives this input, I need to proceed. \n\nAssuming that \"look\" is a valid verb (even though it's not listed in the rules), perhaps the answer should proceed as if \"look\" maps to some action. However, according to the rules, it's not. This is a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" here is a mistake, but the correct approach is to proceed with the rules as given. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look around left\" is parsed differently. Let's think again. The structure is \"look around left twice\". But according to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" applies to a verb. So \"look around left\" would be the verb \"look\" modified by \"around left\". But since \"look\" isn't a primitive, perhaps it's treated as a no-op? But that's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended \"look\" to be a typo for \"walk\", but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that any verb not in the primitive list is simply ignored. But that's not stated in the rules. \n\nThis seems like a possible oversight in the problem setup. However, given that the example works with \"jump\", perhaps \"look\" is invalid. But the problem expects us to generate an output. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\", but that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is supposed to be a different action, but since it's not in the rules, perhaps we should treat it as a no-op, but that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"turn left\", but again, that's a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system should just proceed with the structure, treating \"look\" as a verb, but since there's no mapping, it's omitted. But that would be incorrect. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and \"look\" should be \"jump\", but in the absence of clarification, I have to work with what's given. \n\nAssuming that \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\", \"run\", or \"jump\", but that's not safe. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended \"look\" to be a valid action, and the rules are incomplete. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a red herring, and the correct approach is to parse according to the rules, treating \"look\" as a verb but not having a corresponding action. But in the output, only the specified actions are present. So if \"look\" is not a valid action, then \"look around left\" would not generate any action. But that would be a problem. \n\nThis is a critical point. Since the problem gives this input, it's expected that there is a correct output. Therefore, perhaps \"look\" is a typo and should be treated as a verb that's valid. Alternatively, maybe \"look around left\" is supposed to be handled with the existing rules. Wait, perhaps \"look\" is a direction? No, because \"look\" is in the phrase \"look around left\", which suggests that \"look\" is the verb and \"around left\" modifies it. \n\nBut without a mapping for \"look\", the system can't generate an action. Therefore, this might be a trick question. However, given that the example works, perhaps the problem expects that \"look\" is ignored, but that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"turn left\". Let's try to proceed assuming that \"look\" is the verb, but according to the rules, there's no mapping. So perhaps the problem is designed to have \"look\" not be processed. But that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem intended \"look\" to be a valid verb. Let's proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a valid action, even though it's not listed. Wait, but the rules state that only primitive verbs map to actions. So unless \"look\" is a primitive verb, which it's not, then \"look\" would not generate any action. \n\nThis suggests that the command \"look around left twice\" would generate an invalid action, but the system must parse according to the rules. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a mistake, but we need to proceed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look\" here is a typo for \"turn left\", but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is supposed to be a no-op. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that \"look\" is equivalent to \"turn\" in some way. For example, if \"look\" is \"turn left\", but that's a stretch. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, but needing to produce an answer, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the given structure, treating \"look\" as a verb that maps to a hypothetical I_LOOK action, even though it's not in the rules. However, the example only uses the given mappings. Therefore, strictly following the rules, \"look\" isn't a valid verb, so the system should not generate any action for it. But the problem includes this in the input, so perhaps it's a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended \"look\" to be \"jump\". Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is intended to be ignored, but that complicates things. \n\nGiven that this is a test, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the given rules and note that \"look\" is invalid, but the problem expects an answer. Therefore, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\". But without knowing, this is speculative. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that \"look\" is a valid verb with a corresponding action, even though it's not listed.

The user wants me to process the command \"look right and walk right thrice\". Hmm, first, I need to parse this according to the rules given.\n\nWait, the problem says that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. The verbs listed are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. But here there's \"look right\". Oh, but \"look\" isn't in the list of primitive verbs. Wait, the rules only specify certain verbs as primitives. So maybe \"look right\" isn't a primitive action. But the example given in the problem includes \"jump around right\" which translates into turning right and jumping four times. So maybe \"look right\" isn't a primitive action here. Wait, but then how do we handle it?\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"semantic parsing agent for navigation commands\" and the rules apply to verbs. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" isn't a primitive verb here. But then, how to handle \"look right\"? But the user provided this input. Maybe \"look right\" is treated as a verb phrase, but according to the rules, only the listed primitives are considered. Wait, perhaps the system is supposed to parse only the listed verbs, and \"look right\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, but the example uses \"jump around right\", which uses \"jump\" as the verb. So maybe \"look\" is not a valid action here, but the user might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\"? Because looking right would be turning the direction to the right.\n\nWait, but according to the rules, \"turn right\" is the primitive verb. So \"look right\" isn't a primitive. Hmm. So maybe the input here has a mistake, but since the user provided this input, we need to parse it. Maybe \"look right\" is intended to be treated as \"turn right\"? Or maybe \"look right\" is a non-primitive that's not covered. But according to the problem's rules, we need to process the commands. Let's re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the example input is \"jump around right\", which translates to turning right and jumping four times. So \"jump\" is a primitive verb, and \"around right\" is handled as four repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So each repetition is first turning right, then jumping. So the structure of the action is determined by the rules.\n\nNow, the current input is \"look right and walk right thrice\". Let's break this down. The command is structured as \"A and B\", where A is \"look right\" and B is \"walk right thrice\". According to rule 5, \"A and B\" means do A then B in order.\n\nBut first, we need to parse each part. Let's start with \"look right\". Since \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, perhaps this is a problem. But maybe the user intended \"look right\" to be a verb phrase, but according to the given rules, only the listed verbs are considered. So perhaps \"look right\" isn't a valid primitive. But the input is given, so maybe we have to assume that \"look right\" here is equivalent to \"turn right\", but that's a stretch.\n\nWait, but perhaps \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\"? Because looking right would involve turning the direction to the right. So in the context of navigation, \"look right\" could be interpreted as turning right. If that's the case, then \"look right\" would map to I_TURN_RIGHT. Alternatively, maybe \"look right\" is a different action, but according to the problem's rules, only the listed primitives are considered. So perhaps the system should ignore non-primitive verbs, but the problem requires us to parse the given input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look right\" is not a valid command, but the user might have intended \"walk right\" but mistyped. However, given that the input is \"look right and walk right thrice\", we need to proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps \"look right\" is a non-primitive command. But according to the rules, we need to parse the verbs. Since \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, maybe \"look right\" can't be parsed. However, given that the example uses \"jump\" (a primitive verb) in the input, perhaps the user made a mistake here. But since the assistant must process the input, perhaps we should proceed under the assumption that \"look right\" is a typo for \"walk right\" or \"turn right\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is intended to be \"turn right\", which is a primitive verb. Let's proceed under that assumption, as otherwise the command can't be parsed. So \"look right\" would be \"turn right\", which is I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nThen, moving on. So \"look right\" is parsed as I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nThen the first part of the command is \"look right and walk right thrice\", so according to rule 5: do A then B. A is \"look right\" (I_TURN_RIGHT), B is \"walk right thrice\".\n\nNow, parsing \"walk right thrice\". The verb is \"walk\" which maps to I_WALK. Then \"right\" here would be part of the verb structure. Wait, but according to the rules, \"around <DIR>\" and \"opposite <DIR>\" are modifiers. But \"walk right\" here: is \"right\" an argument to the verb? Or is \"walk\" the verb, and \"right\" is a direction modifier. Wait, according to the rules, how do we handle \"walk right\" or similar phrases?\n\nWait, the original rules don't mention that. The primitive verbs are listed, such as \"walk\", but directions like \"walk left\" aren't covered. The example uses \"jump around right\", which uses the \"around <DIR>\" rule. So perhaps \"walk right\" would be treated as a verb with direction, but according to the given rules, only the verbs as listed are primitives. So \"walk right\" would be considered as the verb \"walk\" followed by direction \"right\", but how does that affect the parsing?\n\nWait, perhaps \"walk right\" is equivalent to \"turn right then walk\"? Or maybe \"walk in the right direction\". However, the rules don't specify that. The rules only specify the modifiers like \"around\", \"opposite\", and repetition with \"twice\" or \"thrice\".\n\nWait, perhaps \"walk right\" is just the verb \"walk\" and the direction \"right\" is not part of the action. But according to the rules, directions are used in \"opposite <DIR>\" and \"around <DIR>\". Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"walk right\" is a misphrasing and the correct parsing is \"walk (verb) and turn right (dir)\".\n\nWait, but according to the rules, perhaps \"walk right\" isn't a primitive. But in the example, \"jump around right\" is parsed into a series of turn right and jumps. So the \"around right\" is a modifier of the verb jump. So perhaps \"walk right\" would be treated as \"walk in direction right\", but according to the rules, how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"walk right\" is a misphrasing and the correct command would be \"turn right and walk\". But given the input \"walk right\", perhaps the user intended \"walk to the right\", but according to the rules, how to parse that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction after a verb is ignored unless it's part of a rule like \"around\" or \"opposite\". For example, \"walk right\" would just be I_WALK, and the \"right\" is extraneous or not processed. But that's a problem. Wait, but in the example, \"jump around right\" uses the around rule. So perhaps \"walk right\" is not a valid structure here, and the \"right\" is not a modifier that we have a rule for. Therefore, perhaps \"walk right\" is parsed as \"walk\" with a direction, but according to the rules, there's no rule to handle this. So maybe \"walk right\" is invalid, but given that the user provided it, perhaps we should ignore the direction and just output I_WALK. But that seems wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"walk right\" implies turning right first, then walking. So similar to \"around right\", but not sure. But the rules don't specify that. Hmm. This is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is \"walk right thrice\". Let's parse that. \"walk\" is the verb, so I_WALK. Then \"right\" could be a direction, but according to the rules, unless it's part of a structure like \"around right\" or \"opposite right\", it's not modified. So \"walk right\" would just be \"walk\", then \"thrice\" applies to the verb. So \"walk right thrice\" would be \"walk thrice\", meaning three times. But the \"right\" here might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user intended \"turn right then walk, thrice\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input should be parsed as \"walk right\" as a verb with direction, but since the rules don't cover that, perhaps the direction is ignored. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"walk right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\" and \"walk\", but again, not sure.\n\nThis is a bit of a problem. The rules don't specify how to handle a verb followed by a direction. So perhaps we can only apply the rules to the verbs that have modifiers. For example, if the input is \"walk around right\", then that would be handled by rule 3. But \"walk right\" alone may not be covered.

The input is \"run around left thrice after turn opposite left twice\". \n\nFirst, according to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So the main structure here is B followed by A. Here, A is \"run around left thrice\" and B is \"turn opposite left twice\". \n\nStarting with B: \"turn opposite left twice\". The word \"opposite left\" means two turns in the left direction. So \"opposite left\" would be two left turns. But wait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no. Wait rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no. Wait the exact rule: \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, but the B here is \"turn opposite left twice\". Hmm, perhaps I need to parse this correctly.\n\nWait, the phrase is \"turn opposite left twice\". Let's parse this. The verb here is \"turn\", and the direction is \"opposite left\". Wait, or is \"opposite left\" the direction modifier for the turn? Let me re-read the rules.\n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, so \"opposite left\" would mean first turn left twice (since two turns in DIR direction), then the verb. Wait, maybe the structure is \"opposite <DIR> modifies the following verb. Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, the example in the rule says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR direction then the verb. Wait, perhaps the correct parsing is that \"opposite left\" would be equivalent to two left turns followed by the verb. Wait, no. Wait, the rule says \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So for example, if you have \"walk opposite left\", it would be two turns left, then walk. Because the verb is walk. So the \"opposite left\" is modifying the verb, meaning that the agent must first turn twice left, then perform the verb. But in the current B part: \"turn opposite left twice\". Hmm, this might be a bit confusing. Let's parse \"turn opposite left twice\". The main verb here is \"turn\", modified by \"opposite left\", and then \"twice\" applies to the entire modified verb.\n\nWait, perhaps \"turn opposite left\" is the verb phrase. So \"turn opposite left\" would be parsed as per rule 2: two turns left (since opposite left means two turns left), then the verb, which is \"turn left\". Wait, but that seems conflicting. Wait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. So if the original command is \"walk opposite left\", that would be two left turns (turn left, turn left), then walk. But if the command is \"turn left opposite left\", then the verb is turn left, modified by opposite left. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps in the phrase \"turn opposite left\", the \"opposite left\" is modifying the direction of the turn. So perhaps \"turn opposite left\" would mean turning right, but that's not directly clear. Maybe I need to parse the structure according to the rules.\n\nWait, the B part is \"turn opposite left twice\". Let's split this into \"turn opposite left\" modified by \"twice\". Let's first process \"turn opposite left\". According to rule 2: \"opposite left\" means two turns left (since two turns in DIR) then the verb. Wait, but the verb here is \"turn\", so would it be: turn is the verb. So \"turn opposite left\" would be: two turns left (turn left, turn left), then do the verb. Wait, but that would mean the verb is turn. So that would result in: turn left, turn left, then turn. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps \"opposite left\" is modifying the direction of the turn. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to parse the B part step by step.\n\nOriginal B: \"turn opposite left twice\". The \"twice\" applies to the entire \"turn opposite left\" action. So we need to first figure out what \"turn opposite left\" is, then repeat it twice.\n\nBreaking down \"turn opposite left\": The main verb is \"turn left\", modified by \"opposite\". According to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"opposite left\" would be two turns left (turn left, turn left) followed by the verb. What's the verb here? The original phrase is \"turn opposite left\", which would be parsed as the verb \"turn\" modified by \"opposite left\". Wait, but \"turn left\" is a direction verb. Hmm, perhaps there's confusion here. Let me re-express the command as per the rules.\n\nWait, the primitive verbs are: turn left→I_TURN_LEFT. So \"turn opposite left\" would be a verb modified by opposite. According to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" (where DIR is a direction) would mean two turns in DIR direction followed by the verb. Wait, in this case, the verb is \"turn left\"? No, perhaps the entire action is \"turn left\", but modified by \"opposite\". So \"turn opposite left\" would be two turns left (turn left, turn left) then the verb \"turn left\". But that would make three left turns. Hmm, that seems possible.\n\nWait, rule 2 says: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So if the original command is a verb V preceded by \"opposite DIR\", then the action sequence is two turns in DIR, then V. But in the case of \"turn opposite left\", the V here is \"turn left\"? Or is the V \"turn\", and the direction is modified by \"opposite left\"?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"opposite left\" is the direction of the verb. For example, if the command was \"walk opposite left\", then according to rule 2, that would be two left turns (turn left, turn left), then walk. Because the verb is walk, modified by opposite left. So \"opposite left\" in this context would mean turning twice left, then performing the action. So applying that to \"turn opposite left\", which is a turn command. The verb here is \"turn left\" perhaps? Not sure. Alternatively, the verb is \"turn\", with direction modified by \"opposite left\". This is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"turn opposite left\" is equivalent to turning right. Because the opposite direction of left is right, so turning opposite left direction would be turning right. But according to the rules, we can't make assumptions like that; we need to follow the rules given.\n\nSo according to rule 2, \"opposite left\" means two turns left (turn left, then turn left again), then the verb. The verb here would be \"turn\". Wait, but \"turn opposite left\" would be parsed as the verb \"turn\" with direction modified by \"opposite left\". Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the command is \"turn opposite left\", which would be \"opposite left\" (two left turns) followed by the verb \"turn left\"? Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is: if the command is \"<verb> opposite <DIR>\", then it's equivalent to two turns in DIR, then the verb. So for example, \"run opposite right\" would be two right turns, then run. So in this case, the B part is \"turn opposite left twice\". The verb here is \"turn left\" (since \"turn left\" is a primitive verb). Wait, but \"turn opposite left\" would be \"opposite left\" modifying the direction of the turn. Alternatively, according to rule 2, \"opposite left\" would be two left turns, then the verb. The verb here would be \"turn left\"? No, that doesn't make sense. Or is the verb \"turn\", which would then have to be clarified. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"turn\" in \"turn opposite left\" is part of the verb, and \"opposite left\" is a direction. But the primitive verbs are turn left and turn right. So \"turn opposite left\" would be equivalent to \"turn right\", but according to rule 2, it would be two left turns (turn left twice), then the verb. The verb here would be \"turn left\"? Not sure.\n\nThis part is tricky. Let's take another approach. Let's parse the entire original command step by step.\n\nOriginal command: run around left thrice after turn opposite left twice.\n\nWhich translates to B followed by A, where:\n\nA = run around left thrice\n\nB = turn opposite left twice\n\nFirst process B: \"turn opposite left twice\"\n\nBreaking down B:\n\n\"turn opposite left\" is the base action, which is then repeated \"twice\".\n\nSo first, process \"turn opposite left\".\n\nRule 2: \"opposite left\" means two turns left, then the verb. The verb here is \"turn left\"? Or is the verb \"turn\", which is ambiguous. Wait, the primitive verbs are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\", which are single actions. So \"turn opposite left\" would be a modification of the \"turn left\" verb.\n\nSo applying rule 2: \"opposite left\" would mean two turns left (turn left, turn left), then the verb. The verb here is \"turn left\". Wait, but that would mean after turning twice left, we do another turn left? That would total three left turns", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The original parsing follows the defined rules consistently. Rule 2 correctly interprets 'opposite left' as two left turns, and applying 'twice' to that sequence means repeating it two times.

Since \"look\" is not a primitive verb, perhaps it's invalid. But since the user included it in the input, maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps \"look opposite right\" should be treated as \"turn opposite right\" but without a verb. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake, and \"look\" should be \"walk\" or another verb. But given the input, I need to process it as per the rules. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo, but I have to work with what's given. Wait, perhaps \"look\" is supposed to be a verb that's not in the primitives, but according to the problem statement, the agent is supposed to parse navigation commands, so \"look\" might not be an action. In that case, maybe the user made a mistake, but the assistant should proceed as best as possible. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" here is a typo for \"jump\". Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is supposed to be ignored. But the problem expects us to handle the command, so maybe \"look opposite right twice\" is parsed as \"opposite right\" which is two turns then the verb \"look\". But since \"look\" isn't a primitive, perhaps it's invalid. However, given that the user provided this input, perhaps the intended action is to replace \"look\" with a valid verb. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a mistake and should be \"walk\". Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is supposed to be a no-op, but that's not likely. Wait, perhaps \"look\" is equivalent to turning direction, but not in the primitives. Hmm. This is a problem. Let me re-examine the rules. Rule 1 says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions: walk→I_WALK, run→I_RUN, jump→I_JUMP, turn left→I_TURN_LEFT, turn right→I_TURN_RIGHT.\" So only these five verbs are allowed. Therefore, \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, so the input may have an error. However, perhaps the problem expects the assistant to proceed regardless. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\". But since I can't confirm, perhaps the correct approach is to treat \"look\" as invalid. However, the example given in the problem uses \"jump around right\" which maps to the actions. So perhaps the problem expects that \"look\" is a verb that doesn't have a corresponding action, which would make the input invalid. But the problem requires processing, so perhaps the user intended \"look\" to be a verb, but it's not listed. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\". Alternatively, maybe \"look opposite right\" should be treated as \"turn opposite right\", but that's speculative. \n\nWait, perhaps the user intended \"look opposite right\" to mean \"turn in the opposite right direction and then look\", but without knowing what \"look\" maps to, we can't proceed. Therefore, this might be a trick question. However, the problem expects an answer, so perhaps \"look\" is treated as a verb that's not in the primitives, which would mean that the command can't be processed. But the assistant is supposed to parse it. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\" or another verb. Since the user wrote \"look opposite right twice\", maybe we can proceed assuming that \"look\" is a valid verb. But according to the given rules, it's not. Hmm. This is a dilemma. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look\" here is a mistake and should be \"jump\", but I can't be sure. Maybe the answer should proceed by assuming that \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\", but that's risky. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is supposed to be ignored, and the \"opposite right\" is processed. Alternatively, perhaps \"look opposite right twice\" means \"turn opposite right (two right turns) and then look, done twice\". But again, without knowing the action for look, this is stuck. \n\nWait, maybe the problem intended \"look\" to be a typo, and the correct verb is \"jump\". Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is supposed to be \"turn left\" or \"turn right\". Not sure. Let me try to proceed. \n\nAssuming that \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\", then \"look opposite right twice\" would be parsed as \"walk opposite right twice\", which would be:\n\nopposite right: two right turns then walk. Then \"twice\" would mean repeating that entire sequence twice. So:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK again. But then the \"twice\" applies to the entire \"look opposite right\", so that would be two times: [turn right twice, walk] then again turn right twice and walk. But wait, \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. Rule 4 says that \"A twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Wait, rule 4 is for \"around\", but rule 5 and 6 are for combining A and B.\n\nWait, rule 4 says: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice; similarly for thrice. So if we have a verb phrase, adding \"twice\" repeats it. So \"look opposite right twice\" would be \"look opposite right\" repeated twice. But again, \"look\" is not a primitive. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is \"look opposite right\" twice. Wait, but \"look opposite right\" would be parsed as \"opposite right\" (two turns right then verb \"look\"). But again, the verb \"look\" is not in the primitives. So this is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended \"look\" to be \"turn left\", but that's a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look opposite right\" is a mistake, and the correct verb is \"jump\". But without knowing, perhaps the correct approach is to ignore the \"look\" part and process the opposite right as two turns, but that seems odd. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended \"look\" to be a valid verb and expects the agent to have an action for it, but since the rules don't list it, maybe the action is I_LOOK. However, according to the problem statement, the rules specify the primitive verbs. So the agent should not recognize other verbs. Therefore, this input might be invalid. But since the problem requires an answer, perhaps there's a mistake, and \"look\" should be \"jump\". Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is supposed to be \"walk\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look opposite right\" is supposed to be \"turn opposite right\", but then \"look\" is ignored. But that's just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is a verb that doesn't have an action, so it's skipped. But that's not specified in the rules. \n\nThis is a problem. Let's try to proceed with the assumption that \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\". Then the input would be \"walk opposite right and jump opposite right twice\". Then we can parse accordingly. \n\nBut the user's input is \"walk opposite right and look opposite right twice\". Since the example uses \"jump around right\" and outputs the correct actions, perhaps \"look\" is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user intended \"look\" to be \"jump\" in the input. But without confirmation, this is risky. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is supposed to be a no-op, but that's not in the rules. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the assistant to ignore unrecognized verbs. But that's not stated. \n\nGiven that this is a test scenario, and the user expects an answer, perhaps the intended approach is to replace \"look\"", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 50, "model_reflection": "The initial response assumed that 'look' was a typo for 'walk', but according to the given rules, only specific primitive verbs are recognized and there is no indication that 'look' should be interpreted as 'walk'.

According to the rules, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So first, I need to parse \"turn right\" which is straightforward: I_TURN_RIGHT. Then the \"jump right\" part. Wait, \"jump right\" isn't a primitive verb. The primitive verbs are things like jump, turn left, turn right. Hmm, maybe \"jump right\" is a direction? But looking at the rules, the only primitives are the ones listed. Wait, the original command is \"jump around right\" which maps to turn right then jump, repeated four times. Wait, no: rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"jump around right\" would be four times: turn right then jump. Wait, the example given was \"jump around right\" becomes four I_TURN_RIGHT followed by I_JUMP each time, but the example output shows four turns and four jumps, each pair. So each repetition is a turn then a jump. So \"jump around right\" would be [turn right, jump] repeated four times.\n\nBut back to the current problem. The command here is \"jump right after turn right\". Let's parse that. The structure is \"A after B\", so B is \"turn right\" which is I_TURN_RIGHT. Then A is \"jump right\". Wait, but \"jump right\" isn't a primitive. So perhaps \"jump right\" is a jump in the right direction? Or maybe it's a mistake. Wait, the original problem says \"semantic parsing agent for navigation commands\", so the input is natural language. So \"jump right\" might be interpreted as a direction. Wait, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are the ones listed. Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" maps to two turns in DIR then the verb. Rule 3 \"around <DIR>\" uses four repetitions of turn DIR plus verb. So \"jump around right\" would be four times: turn right, jump. Wait, but in the example given, the output for \"jump around right\" is four turns right and four jumps, each pair. So each iteration is a turn right and a jump, so four times.\n\nBut in this problem, the input is \"jump right after turn right\". Let's parse each part. \"turn right\" is I_TURN_RIGHT. Then \"jump right\". Hmm. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump\" is a primitive verb. \"right\" alone is a direction. So \"jump right\" might be a direction modifier. Wait, but according to the rules, the only way directions come in is via \"opposite <DIR>\" or \"around <DIR>\". So \"jump right\" isn't a primitive. Therefore, perhaps \"jump right\" is a mistake, or maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe \"jump\" is the verb, and \"right\" is a direction modifier, but the rules don't specify that. Wait, the problem says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\", so each verb like 'walk' is a primitive. So \"jump\" is a primitive verb, but \"turn right\" is also a primitive verb. So \"jump right\" isn't a primitive verb. So perhaps \"jump right\" is being used incorrectly here. But the user input is \"jump right after turn right\". Let's see. The structure is \"A after B\", where A is \"jump right\" and B is \"turn right\". So according to the rules, we need to parse A and B.\n\nBut how to parse \"jump right\"? Since \"jump\" is a primitive verb, but \"right\" here might be a direction modifier. Wait, but according to the given rules, the only way directions are handled is in \"opposite <DIR>\" and \"around <DIR>\". So perhaps \"jump right\" is not a valid command. But the user provided it. Hmm. Wait, maybe \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"turn right then jump\", but that's not according to the rules. Alternatively, maybe \"jump right\" is a mistake, and the intended meaning is \"jump to the right\", but according to the rules, how to parse it? The problem says that the agent must process the command according to the given rules, so if the input isn't following the rules, how to handle it? But maybe the user made a mistake. Wait, but the example given in the problem is \"jump around right\", which is parsed as jump around right, leading to the four repetitions. So perhaps \"jump right\" is parsed as jump followed by a direction. But according to the rules, there's no such primitive. Alternatively, maybe the \"right\" in \"jump right\" is part of a turn command. Alternatively, maybe the entire phrase is parsed as \"jump\" and \"right\" as separate. Wait, perhaps the input is supposed to be \"jump and turn right\" but written as \"jump right\". Alternatively, maybe the user intended \"jump, turn right\" or something else.\n\nWait, but according to the problem's rules, the user input must be parsed with the given rules. So the command is \"jump right after turn right\". The structure is \"A after B\", where A is \"jump right\" and B is \"turn right\". But how to parse A? Let's see. Since \"jump right\" is not a primitive verb, but \"jump\" is, and \"right\" is a direction. So maybe \"jump right\" is being modified with \"right\" as a direction. However, according to the rules, such a construct isn't specified. Rule 2 is \"opposite <DIR>\" which is two turns in DIR then the verb. Rule 3 is \"around <DIR>\". So perhaps \"jump right\" is invalid, but since the user provided it, maybe we have to assume that \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"jump\" followed by turning right. Or perhaps \"jump right\" is a typo and should be \"turn right then jump\". Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use \"jump\" with direction, which is not covered in the rules. Hmm. This is a problem. Maybe there's a mistake in the input command, but given that the user provided it, we have to find a way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is parsed as \"jump\" followed by \"turn right\", but that's not according to the given rules. Wait, the problem says that \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\", so the agent should parse the input into the allowed primitives. Therefore, \"jump right\" must be broken down into allowed primitives. So \"jump\" is a primitive verb. \"right\" could be part of another command. So maybe \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"jump and turn right\", but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is a misstatement, and the intended command is \"turn right and jump\", which would be parsed as I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP. But how to parse \"jump right\"?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump right\" is a mistake and should be \"jump around right\", but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended \"jump to the right\", which would require turning right first, then jumping. But according to the rules, \"around\" and \"opposite\" modify the verb. So maybe \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"turn right then jump\". But the rules don't specify that. Unless \"jump right\" is a direction-based verb, but the rules don't account for that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump right\" is a typo for \"turn right\", but that's not helpful. Let's try to think differently. Let's look at the structure of the problem. The command is \"jump right after turn right\". According to rule 6, this should be parsed as B then A, where B is \"turn right\" (I_TURN_RIGHT) and A is \"jump right\". Now, how to parse \"jump right\". Wait, perhaps \"jump right\" is a repetition. Or maybe \"jump right\" is \"jump opposite right\" or something else. But the input is unclear. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo and meant \"jump around right\", which would be covered by rule 3, but that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump right\" is a verb followed by a direction, but not using any of the rules. Then, according to the rules, the only way to parse it would be as I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT. But that's assuming that \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"jump and turn right\", which would be \"jump\" (I_JUMP) and \"turn right\" (I_TURN_RIGHT). But that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe \"jump right\" is a mistake and should be \"turn right and jump\", but again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump right\" is parsed as a single action, but since it's not a primitive verb, it would be invalid. However, the problem requires processing the command. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Let's think again. The problem says \"jump around right\" becomes four times [turn right jump], which is four times two actions each. So \"around right\" modifies the verb 'jump' to become a sequence of turn right then jump, repeated four times. Similarly, \"opposite right\" would be two turns right then the verb.\n\nSo, for \"jump right after turn right\": the command is parsed as \"jump right\" after \"turn right\", so execute \"turn right\" then \"jump right\". The problem is parsing \"jump right\". Since there's no rule for a verb followed by a direction unless it's \"around\" or \"opposite\", perhaps \"jump right\" is invalid. But the problem expects an answer. Maybe \"jump right\" is simply I_JUMP followed by I_TURN", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The command 'jump right after turn right' uses the structure 'A after B', which according to the rules means 'do B then A in order'. Here, 'jump right' is A and 'turn right' is B. Therefore, the correct interpretation is to first 'turn right' and then 'jump right'. The output 'I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT' accurately reflects this sequence. The initial answer is correct because it follows the rule for 'A after B' and correctly maps 'jump right' to 'I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT'.", "new_response": "None"}

So I need to process \"look around left\" first, then \"walk around right thrice\".\n\nStarting with \"look around left\". The verb here is \"look\", but wait, looking isn't one of the primitive verbs listed. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Hmm, but the user mentioned \"look around left\". Wait, the rules don't mention anything about \"look\". That might be a problem. Maybe \"look\" is intended to be a turn action. Wait, the example uses \"jump around right\" which becomes I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times. So \"jump\" is a primitive verb. But \"look\" isn't in the primitive verbs. Maybe \"look\" here is a typo or maybe it's supposed to be a turn. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended \"look around left\" to be a series of turns. Wait, but according to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the structure is \"verb around DIR\", which would imply that the verb is part of each repetition. But if the verb isn't a primitive, how to handle that? The problem says that the input is a navigation command, so maybe \"look\" here is supposed to be \"turn left\"? Or perhaps \"look\" is a primitive verb that's not listed. But according to the initial rules, the primitive verbs are specifically walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, there's a problem here. \n\nWait, maybe the example in the problem statement uses \"jump around right\" which maps to the turn and jump. So \"jump\" is a primitive verb. Therefore, \"look around left\" would need to be parsed. But \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. This seems like a contradiction. Is there a mistake in the input, or is there a missing rule? Since the problem states that I should process the command, perhaps \"look\" should be treated as a different verb. Wait, looking back at the rules, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" is not a primitive. Therefore, how to handle this? Maybe the user made a mistake, but perhaps \"look around left\" is intended to be \"turn left\" four times as part of the \"around\" command. Wait, but according to rule 3, \"around left\" would be 4 repetitions of [turn left + verb]. So the verb here is \"look\". But \"look\" isn't a primitive. That's a problem. \n\nThis is confusing. Maybe \"look\" here is a typo for \"walk\"? Or maybe \"look\" is intended to be a no-op? But that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is considered a primitive verb not listed here, but according to the rules, only the given primitives map to actions. Therefore, the presence of \"look\" in the input may be an error. But since the user provided this input, I need to process it. Perhaps the problem assumes that \"look\" maps to one of the existing primitives. Let me check the example again. The example input was \"jump around right\", which maps to turning right and jumping four times. So \"jump\" is a primitive. But here, \"look\" isn't in the primitive list. Maybe \"look\" is supposed to be \"turn left\"? Or perhaps the user intended \"look\" to be a verb that's not covered, which would mean the problem has an error. Since the problem expects an answer, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\", but that's risky. Alternatively, maybe \"look around left\" is supposed to be handled with the \"around\" rule, but with \"look\" as the verb. If the system allows for other verbs, but according to the rules, only the listed primitives are allowed. \n\nWait, the problem says \"semantic parsing agent for navigation commands\", and the rules specify how to map the input to actions. The first rule says primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So if a verb isn't in the primitive list, perhaps it's not recognized. However, the input includes \"look\", which is not a primitive. This is a problem. But since the user expects an answer, perhaps \"look\" is a mistake and should be \"walk\", or maybe \"look\" is intended to be treated as a different action. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is equivalent to a turn. Alternatively, maybe \"look around left\" is a way to express turning around, like four times left, but I need to follow the rules strictly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look around left\" is parsed as follows: \"look\" is the verb, and \"around left\" is the modifier. According to rule 3, \"around left\" would expand to 4 repetitions of [turn left + look]. But \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. Since the problem's rules don't specify how to handle non-primitive verbs, perhaps \"look\" is invalid. But since the user provided this, perhaps we have to assume that \"look\" is a valid verb. But according to the problem's rules, only the listed ones are. Therefore, this is a problem. However, the user might have made a mistake here, but I need to proceed. Maybe \"look\" maps to a no-op, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is treated as a different action, but the problem hasn't specified how. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look around left\" is intended to be a different command, but according to the given rules, we have to apply rule 3. Let's proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a primitive verb. But according to the initial rules, it's not. So maybe there's an error in the input. But given that the example uses \"jump around right\", which does use a primitive verb, perhaps \"look\" is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" here is supposed to be \"walk\". But without further information, I'm stuck. Wait, perhaps the problem is designed to have \"look around left\" treated as \"turn left\" four times? No, because rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the verb must be present. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\". But that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the \"look\" and just process the \"around left\" as turns. But that seems unlikely. \n\nThis is a tricky part. Let's try to proceed. Maybe \"look around left\" is equivalent to \"turn left around left\", but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended \"look around left\" to mean turning around, which would be two turns left (as per rule 2, which says opposite direction is two turns), but that's not rule 3. Rule 3 says \"around\" is four turns and the verb. So perhaps the problem expects that \"look\" is a valid verb, even though it's not listed. Maybe the primitive verbs list is incomplete. Let's assume that \"look\" is a valid primitive verb. But according to the initial rules, it's not. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to map \"look\" to a non-action, but that's not specified. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting that \"look\" maps to \"I_TURN_LEFT\" because looking around might involve turning. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe \"look around left\" is being used here to mean \"turn left four times\", but that's not according to the rules. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look around left\" is parsed as \"around left\" modifying \"look\", but since \"look\" isn't a primitive, the action is skipped. But that would lead to no action for that part. Which seems unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the fact that \"look\" isn't a primitive and just create an action I_LOOK. But according to the rules, only the primitive verbs are mapped. Therefore, this input may be invalid, but since the user provided it, perhaps we have to proceed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\". If I proceed with that assumption, then \"look around left\" becomes \"walk around left\", which would expand to 4 repetitions of turn left and walk. But that's a big assumption. However, given that the user provided this input, perhaps that's the intended approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" maps to \"I_TURN_LEFT\" because looking in the direction you're facing. But that's not stated in the rules. \n\nHmm. Since I'm stuck here, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that \"look\" is a valid verb that maps to an action not listed, but according to the rules, it's not. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a mistake, but I need to proceed. Let's look at the other part first. \n\nThe second part is \"walk around right thrice\". Let's parse that. \"walk\" is a primitive verb (I_WALK). \"around right\" is rule 3, which would expand to 4 repetitions of [turn right + walk]. Then \"thrice\" applies to that entire sequence. So \"walk around right\" is the sequence I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK repeated four times.

The input is \"look right twice and walk opposite right twice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part. The first part is \"look right twice\". But wait, according to the rules, primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. However, \"look\" isn't listed in the primitive verbs. The primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look right\" might be equivalent to turning right, but looking isn't a primitive action. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, the user might have intended \"look right\" as a turn right action. Because the examples given use the primitive verbs listed. So maybe \"look right\" should be treated as \"turn right\", which maps to I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nThen \"twice\" means repeating the action twice. So \"look right twice\" would be two I_TURN_RIGHT actions. \n\nNext, \"and walk opposite right twice\". The \"and\" rule (rule 5) means do the first part then the second part. So first do the look right twice (two turns right), then the walk opposite right twice.\n\nNow, \"opposite right\" (rule 2) means two turns in the direction (right) then the verb. Wait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no: the verb is the action that follows. So \"opposite right\" would mean first turn right twice, then perform the verb. Wait, no. Wait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, perhaps the verb is the action that comes after opposite. For example, if the command was \"walk opposite right\", then it would be two turns right plus the walk. But here, the verb is \"walk\", and \"opposite right\" is part of the noun phrase. So \"walk opposite right twice\" would be the action to walk in the opposite right direction, twice. Wait, maybe \"opposite right\" is a direction, but I'm confused. Let me re-read rule 2.\n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"opposite left\" would mean two turns left, then the verb. So the entire phrase \"opposite <DIR> <verb>\" would translate to turning DIR twice then doing the verb. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is that \"opposite <DIR>\" is a direction modifier. But the way the rule is written: \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, maybe the phrase is \"verb opposite DIR\". For example, \"walk opposite right\" would mean first turn right twice (opposite direction), then walk. Wait, but how does that fit the rule? The rule says that \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. So perhaps the \"opposite <DIR>\" is a direction modifier to the verb, which requires two turns in the DIR direction before doing the verb. But that seems counterintuitive. For example, if someone says \"walk opposite left\", that would mean turn left twice (which is a 180-degree turn), then walk. So that makes sense. So the \"opposite left\" is equivalent to turning left twice (180 degrees) to face the opposite direction, then perform the action. But according to the rule, \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. So the two turns are in the DIR direction, not the opposite. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let's parse the rule again.\n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"opposite right\" would mean two turns right (which would result in facing opposite direction, since each turn right is 90 degrees, so two would be 180 degrees), then the verb. So the action sequence would be I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT, then the verb's action. Wait, but in the example given by the user, \"jump around right\" becomes four turns right and jumps each time, leading to four repetitions. So the example seems to use the rules as written.\n\nSo in the current problem, the second part is \"walk opposite right twice\". Let's parse \"walk opposite right\". According to rule 2, \"opposite right\" would mean two turns right, then the verb (walk). So the action sequence would be two I_TURN_RIGHT followed by I_WALK. Then \"twice\" applies to this sequence. Wait, but \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. Wait, the phrase is \"walk opposite right twice\". So \"twice\" applies to the entire \"walk opposite right\" action. Wait, no: \"walk opposite right twice\" is \"walk opposite right\" modified by \"twice\". Let's break it down.\n\nThe structure is: [walk opposite right] twice. So the entire action of walking opposite right is repeated twice. But according to rule 2, \"walk opposite right\" would be two turns right plus the walk. So one repetition of \"walk opposite right\" would be I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_WALK. Then \"twice\" would mean doing this entire sequence twice. So each repetition would be two turns right, walk, and then again two turns right, walk. But wait, that would be each repetition. Alternatively, \"twice\" would mean the entire verb sequence is done twice. So \"walk opposite right\" is the same as two turns right then walk, so \"twice\" would make it two turns right, walk, two turns right, walk. However, perhaps the \"twice\" applies to the entire phrase \"opposite right twice\". Wait, the input is \"walk opposite right twice\". So \"opposite right twice\" is part of the phrase. Hmm, perhaps not. Let's parse the original command again.\n\nOriginal command: \"look right twice and walk opposite right twice\". Breaking it into parts:\n\nPart 1: \"look right twice\" → process into actions.\n\nPart 2: \"walk opposite right twice\" → process into actions.\n\nSo for part 2: \"walk opposite right twice\". The \"opposite right\" is a direction modifier (rule 2). So walk opposite right is two turns right + I_WALK. Then \"twice\" would mean repeating this twice. So each time, you do two turns right, then walk, and repeat that entire sequence twice. Wait, but rule 4 says that \"twice\" means repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, rule 4 says: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So in this case, the entire verb sequence is \"walk opposite right\", which would be two turns right + walk. So \"walk opposite right twice\" would mean doing that sequence (two turns right, walk) twice. Wait, but \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. Hmm, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"walk opposite right twice\" is parsed as walk opposite (right twice), but that's not likely. Let's go step by step.\n\nFirst, the structure of the command is: [look right] twice AND [walk opposite right] twice.\n\nBut according to rule 4, \"twice\" applies to the verb. So \"look right twice\" is the verb \"look right\" (which is a turn right?) followed by twice. Wait, \"look right\" is not a primitive verb. The primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look right\" is not a primitive. Therefore, perhaps there's an error here, but the user might have intended \"look right\" as \"turn right\". Alternatively, maybe \"look right\" is a different action not covered by the primitives. But according to the rules, only the primitives listed are allowed. Therefore, perhaps \"look right\" should be ignored or considered as a typo. However, the example uses \"jump around right\", which is handled as per the rules. So perhaps \"look right\" is not a valid command. But given that the user provided this input, we have to work around.\n\nWait, maybe \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\", since looking right would involve turning that way. So assuming \"look right\" maps to I_TURN_RIGHT. Then \"look right twice\" would be two I_TURN_RIGHTs.\n\nNow, the second part: \"walk opposite right twice\".\n\nFirst, \"walk opposite right\" → according to rule 2, \"opposite right\" would mean two turns right, then the verb (walk). So the action sequence for \"walk opposite right\" is two turns right plus walk: I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_WALK.\n\nThen \"twice\" would mean repeating this entire sequence twice. So according to rule 4: \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So the verb here is \"walk opposite right\", which is the sequence above. Therefore, repeating that twice would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK\n\nNow, combining the first part \"look right twice\" which is two I_TURN_RIGHTs, and \"and walk opposite right twice\" which is the sequence above, then according to rule 5: \"A and B\" means A then B. So the entire sequence is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT (from look right twice) followed by I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK (from walk opposite right twice twice).\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. The first part is \"look right twice\" which we're treating as two I_TURN_RIGHT. Then the second part is \"walk opposite right twice\", which is two times (turn right twice and walk).

The input is: \"turn around left twice and walk opposite left thrice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part according to the rules. Let's split it into two main parts because of the \"and\" which means do A then B. So the first part is \"turn around left twice\" and the second part is \"walk opposite left thrice\".\n\nStarting with \"turn around left twice\". The rule for \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb is \"turn\", but wait, actually \"turn around left\" would be the base here. Wait, wait. Wait, \"around left\" applies to the verb. Wait, the original phrase is \"turn around left twice\". Hmm, need to parse this correctly.\n\nWait, \"turn around left\" is a single command. Wait, the original command is \"turn around left twice\". Let me think. The structure is \"turn around left twice\". Wait, \"around left\" is a modifier for the verb \"turn\". Wait, no. Wait, according to rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Wait, wait, no. Rule 3 says that \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"turn around left\" would be parsed as \"around left\" modifying the verb. Wait, no. Wait, the command \"turn around left\" would be \"around left\" applied to the verb. Wait, no, \"turn\" is the verb, then \"around left\" is a modifier. So \"turn around left\" would be equivalent to the rule 3. So \"turn around left\" would be 4 times [turn left + turn]. Wait, the verb here is \"turn\", so each repetition would be [turn left then turn]. Wait, no. Wait, rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" means 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So if the verb is \"turn\", then each repetition would be \"turn DIR\" followed by the verb \"turn\". Wait, but that seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the verb in this case is \"turn\", so \"turn around left\" would be expanding \"around left\" as per rule 3. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, \"turn around left\" would be the verb \"turn\" modified by \"around left\". So according to rule 3: \"around left\" means 4 repetitions of [turn left + verb]. So the verb here is \"turn\". So each repetition is \"turn left\" followed by \"turn\". Therefore, \"turn around left\" becomes 4 repetitions of [I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN], concatenated. Then, the command says \"turn around left twice\". So \"twice\" applies to the entire \"turn around left\" sequence. Wait, no. Wait, the original part is \"turn around left twice\". Let's parse this. The main verb is \"turn\", modified by \"around left\" and then \"twice\". So first, \"around left\" applies to the verb \"turn\", creating a sequence that is repeated four times. Then \"twice\" would repeat that entire sequence twice. Wait, no. Wait, the \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. Rule 4 says \"verb twice\" is repeat twice. But in this case, the phrase is \"turn around left twice\". So \"around left\" applies to the verb \"turn\", then \"twice\" applies to the entire \"around left\" sequence. Hmm, perhaps.\n\nWait, let's parse \"turn around left twice\". The structure is: the verb is \"turn\", then \"around left\" modifies it, then \"twice\" modifies that entire verb sequence. Wait, but how. Let's see. According to rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"turn around left\" would be the verb \"turn\" with \"around left\", which would replace it with four repetitions of [turn left, turn]. Then \"twice\" would take that entire sequence and repeat it twice.\n\nWait, but \"around left\" is a modifier on the verb \"turn\", so the entire \"turn around left\" would be four repetitions of [turn left then turn]. Then \"twice\" would repeat that entire block twice. So \"turn around left twice\" would be the four repetitions multiplied by two. Let's compute that.\n\nOriginal \"turn around left\" (rule 3) would be:\n\n[turn left, turn] repeated four times.\n\nSo that's:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN\n\nThen \"twice\" would take that entire sequence and repeat it twice. Wait, no. Wait, rule 4 says \"verb twice\" means repeat the verb sequence twice. But in this case, the verb is \"turn around left\", which is already a modified verb. So \"turn around left twice\" would be equivalent to \"turn around left\" followed by \"turn around left\" again. Which would be each of their sequences. So the entire \"turn around left\" sequence (four [turn left + turn] pairs) is repeated twice. So total 8 times [turn left, turn]? Hmm, that seems possible.\n\nWait, but according to rule 4: \"A twice\" is two times the sequence. So if \"turn around left\" is a sequence of four [turn left + turn], then \"turn around left twice\" would be that sequence repeated twice. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, \"turn around left\" is the verb modified by \"around left\". So the entire sequence from rule 3 is the verb. Then \"twice\" would repeat that entire sequence twice. So \"turn around left twice\" would be the four repetitions of [turn left + turn], then again four repetitions of [turn left + turn]. So total eight I_TURN_LEFT and eight I_TURN? Hmm.\n\nSo first part of the command gives us eight I_TURN_LEFT and eight I_TURN.\n\nNow moving to the second part: \"walk opposite left thrice\". This is \"walk\" modified by \"opposite left\" and then \"thrice\".\n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no: rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no: wait, the rule says \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no. Wait, rule 2 says: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, wait. Wait, the way to go opposite direction is to turn twice in DIR, then perform the verb. Wait, original rule 2 says that \"opposite <DIR>\" means two turns in DIR followed by the verb. So for \"walk opposite left\", you would do two I_TURN_LEFT, then I_WALK.\n\nBut in this case, the part here is \"walk opposite left thrice\". So the structure is \"walk\" modified by \"opposite left\", then \"thrice\" meaning repeat thrice. So first parse \"walk opposite left\": according to rule 2, this is two I_TURN_LEFT, then I_WALK. Then \"thrice\" would repeat that entire sequence three times.\n\nSo \"walk opposite left thrice\" becomes:\n\n[I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK] repeated three times.\n\nNow, the entire input command is \"A and B\", so A then B. So first process \"turn around left twice\" then \"walk opposite left thrice\".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFirst part (turn around left twice):\n\nEach \"turn around left\" is four times [turn left + turn], so four repetitions:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN (x4)\n\nWhich would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN\n\nThen \"twice\" means doing that entire \"turn around left\" sequence twice. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the original first part is \"turn around left twice\". The \"twice\" applies to the \"turn around left\". So the entire \"turn around left\" sequence is done twice. Wait, but according to rule 3, \"around left\" applied to \"turn\" gives four repetitions. Then \"twice\" would make the entire around left done twice. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the command is \"turn around left twice\". So \"turn\" is the verb, modified by \"around left\" (rule 3), then \"twice\" (rule 4). Rule 4 says \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. But if the verb is modified by other terms, like \"around left\", then \"twice\" applies to the entire sequence. So \"turn around left\" becomes the expanded sequence of four [turn left + turn], and then \"twice\" would repeat that fourfold sequence twice. So:\n\nFirst, the \"turn around left\" is:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN (repeated four times) = eight actions.\n\nThen \"twice\" would repeat all those eight actions again. So total 16 actions: eight multiplied by two.\n\nWait, but the original instruction says for \"twice\" to repeat the verb sequence twice. So the verb here is \"turn around left\", which after expansion into a sequence, then \"twice\" would repeat that sequence twice. So yes, that would be two times the four [turn left + turn].\n\nSo first part becomes:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN repeated four times, then again repeated four times. Wait, no. Wait, the first \"turn around left\" is four [turn left + turn], then \"twice\" would make two copies of that four", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 50, "model_reflection": "The original response incorrectly interprets 'turn around left twice' by repeating the entire 'around left' sequence twice.

Wait, but \"turn around left\" would mean each time you turn left and then perform the verb. Wait, the original verb here is \"turn\", so the entire action becomes \"around left\" applied to \"turn\". But wait, \"around left\" would be doing \"turn left then turn\", four times. Wait, no. Let me check rule 3 again.\n\nRule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the verb here is \"turn\". So each repetition is \"turn DIR\" followed by the verb. Wait, the original phrase is \"turn around left twice\". So first, \"turn around left\" would be the \"around left\" applied to the verb \"turn\". So each of the four repetitions would be: turn left then turn. But wait, \"turn around left\" would be the same as \"around left\" modifying \"turn\". So that would be [turn left + turn] repeated four times? Hmm. Wait, no. Wait, \"around left\" for a verb V would be four times [turn left then V]. So for each of the four steps, you turn left then do V. So in this case, V is \"turn\". Wait, but \"turn\" here is the verb. Wait, but \"turn\" is the action, so the original \"turn around left\" would be the V being \"turn\", so each time you turn left then turn. Wait, but that seems a bit recursive. Let me think.\n\nWait, the original command starts with \"turn around left twice\". Wait, \"turn around left\" is modified by \"twice\". Wait, wait. The command is \"turn around left twice and look opposite right\". So \"turn around left twice\" is a part, then \"and\" connects to \"look opposite right\".\n\nWait, according to rule 5, \"A and B\" means A then B. So the entire command is (turn around left twice) and (look opposite right). Let's parse each part.\n\nFirst, \"turn around left twice\": the base is \"turn around left\", which is modified by \"twice\". But wait, how does \"twice\" work. Rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if we have a verb phrase, adding \"twice\" repeats the entire sequence twice.\n\nSo first, \"turn around left\" would be processed as per rule 3.

But wait, \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left/right. Wait, the initial rule says primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. Hmm. Wait, the problem here might be that the command includes non-primitive verbs, but according to the rules, only the listed primitive verbs are allowed. But the example uses \"jump around right\" which is allowed. Wait, maybe \"look\" is supposed to be a primitive verb, but in the initial rules, it's not listed. But in the example, \"jump\" is allowed. So perhaps the user made a mistake? Or maybe \"look\" is a verb here. Wait, the problem statement says \"navigation commands\", which may include looking directions.\n\nWait, but according to the given rules, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" isn't among them. However, the input command has \"look opposite right\". So maybe \"look\" here is considered a verb, but according to the rules, the agent should map primitive verbs to their uppercase actions. If \"look\" is not a primitive verb, then perhaps it's not recognized. However, the problem says to process the command as given, so maybe \"look\" is a typo or perhaps we should treat it as a verb. But according to the rules, only the listed verbs are primitives. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, perhaps \"look\" is a verb that's not in the primitive list, but the user expects that we can process it as if it's a verb. But according to the rules, the agent should process only the given primitives. Maybe the user intended \"look\" to be \"turn\" or another verb, but the problem says to process the given input. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a new primitive verb, but the rules don't list it. This is a possible inconsistency.\n\nBut given that the problem presents this input, we need to proceed. Let's assume that \"look\" here is a typo and the intended verb is \"turn\", or perhaps it's a new primitive. Alternatively, perhaps \"look opposite right\" would be treated as \"turn opposite right\", but the problem says to process as per the rules. Let's proceed with the information we have.\n\nAssuming that \"look\" is a verb that is allowed, but according to the rules, the agent maps primitive verbs to uppercase actions. If \"look\" is not in the primitive list, then this is an error. However, given that the user provided this input, perhaps we should treat \"look\" as a primitive verb. Wait, the initial list of primitive verbs includes walk, run, jump, turn left/right. So \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitives. So \"look\" is not a primitive. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake here, but we have to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is intended to be equivalent to \"turn\" in this context. But that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a different action, but according to the rules, we should ignore it unless specified. Hmm. This is a problem. But since the problem requires processing the input, perhaps we can proceed under the assumption that \"look\" should be treated as \"turn\", or perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the agent should output the uppercase version of the verb, like I_LOOK. But the rules don't mention that. The initial instruction says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\", and lists the primitives. So if \"look\" is not a primitive, then the agent can't process it. However, since the example uses \"jump\", which is a listed primitive, perhaps the user intended \"look\" to be a primitive. Wait, but in the input, the command is \"look opposite right\". Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look opposite right\" is equivalent to \"turn opposite right\". If that's the case, then we can proceed. But without knowing the mapping, this is a guess. Let's proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a typo for \"turn left\" or \"turn right\", but given the input, we have to work with it. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" here is intended to be a new primitive verb, so we would map \"look\" to I_LOOK. However, the initial rules don't mention this. But the example doesn't include any other verbs. So maybe this is a problem. However, the user's example uses \"jump around right\", which works with the rules. So perhaps the user intended \"look\" to be a verb. But according to the given rules, only the listed verbs are primitives. So this input would be invalid. But since it's given, perhaps we should proceed by treating \"look\" as a primitive verb, but the agent's rules don't list it. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look\" here is a mistake, and the correct verb is \"turn left\" or \"turn right\", but the problem says to process the input. Since this is a test, perhaps the intended approach is to treat \"look\" as a valid verb. However, the rules don't specify how to handle verbs not in the primitive list. The problem states that the agent is a semantic parsing agent for navigation commands, so maybe it can handle other verbs. But according to the first rule, only the primitives are mapped. Therefore, \"look\" might not be a valid command, leading to an error, but the problem expects us to process it. Since this is a problem presented for solution, perhaps we need to proceed with the assumption that \"look\" is a typo and the intended verb is \"turn\", so \"look opposite right\" would be equivalent to \"turn opposite right\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the agent is supposed to handle any verb, mapping their first letter, but that's unclear. Alternatively, the problem might have a typo. Let's proceed under the assumption that \"look\" should be treated as \"turn\", but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a verb that doesn't have an associated action, but that would make the output invalid. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a no-op. Not sure. But given that we need to process this input, let's proceed with the available rules and see.\n\nLet's focus on the first part: \"turn around left twice\". \n\nBreaking down \"turn around left\": according to rule 3, \"around left\" means 4 repetitions of [turn left + turn].

The input is \"jump opposite left thrice after turn left\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the structure. According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So the main structure here is: [turn left] followed by [jump opposite left thrice].\n\nStarting with the \"turn left\" part. That's straightforward—it maps to I_TURN_LEFT.\n\nNow, the second part is \"jump opposite left thrice\". Let's dissect this. The \"opposite left\" part refers to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" means two turns in DIR then the verb. So opposite left would be two left turns, which would be equivalent to turning right (since each left turn is 90 degrees, two makes 180). Then, the verb here is jump. But also, the \"thrice\" means repeating that entire sequence three times.\n\nWait, but \"opposite left\" would be two turns left, then jump. Then the \"thrice\" applies to the entire \"jump opposite left\" sequence. Wait, actually, the structure is \"jump opposite left\" thrice. Let's parse that. So each repetition of \"jump opposite left\" would be: two left turns, then jump. Then, doing this three times because of \"thrice\".\n\nBut wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb], but here we have \"opposite left\" which is two turns left, then the verb. And then the verb here is \"jump\". But the \"thrice\" is modifying \"jump opposite left\", so the entire \"opposite left\" plus jump is repeated three times?\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express \"jump opposite left thrice\". The \"opposite left\" is a direction modifier for the jump. So the \"jump opposite left\" is one action: two left turns, then jump. Then \"thrice\" means we repeat that entire action three times. So each \"jump opposite left\" takes two left turns and a jump, and we do that three times.\n\nBut wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"around right\" would be turn right, verb, repeat 4 times. But here, \"opposite left\" is two turns left, then the verb. Then \"thrice\" would mean that the entire \"jump opposite left\" is done three times. So each time you do two left turns, then a jump, and repeat that thrice.\n\nWait, but \"jump opposite left thrice\" as per the rules. Let's parse \"jump opposite left\" first. According to rule 2, opposite left means two left turns, then the verb. So the verb here is jump. So the sequence would be: I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_JUMP. Then \"thrice\" (rule 4, but rule 4 is for \"around\", here we have \"thrice\" applying to the verb sequence. Rule 4 is a different case. According to rule 4, \"around <DIR>\" is 4 reps of [turn DIR + verb], but here, the \"opposite left\" is part of the verb. Then \"thrice\" applies to the entire \"jump opposite left\" which is the verb modified by opposite left. Wait, no. Let's see. The original command is \"jump opposite left thrice after turn left\". So the \"jump opposite left\" is modified by \"thrice\"—so we have to repeat the entire \"jump opposite left\" three times. Wait, but \"jump opposite left\" itself is two turns and a jump. If we do that three times, then the sequence would be:\n\nEach \"jump opposite left\" is:\n\nTurn left, turn left, jump.\n\nDoing this three times would be:\n\nTurn left, turn left, jump, turn left, turn left, jump, turn left, turn left, jump.\n\nBut wait, but according to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. So each \"opposite left\" is two left turns, then the verb. So the verb here is jump. So each \"jump opposite left\" is two left turns then a jump. So doing that thrice would be three times:\n\nFirst time: I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_JUMP\n\nSecond time: I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_JUMP\n\nThird time: I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_JUMP\n\nSo the entire sequence for \"jump opposite left thrice\" would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP repeated three times.\n\nSo that's 3*(turn left, turn left, jump) = total of 9 steps.\n\nSo putting it all together. The entire command is \"jump opposite left thrice after turn left\", which per rule 6, do \"turn left\" first, then \"jump opposite left thrice\".\n\nSo:\n\nFirst, do the turn left: I_TURN_LEFT.\n\nThen, do the \"jump opposite left thrice\": which is three repetitions of [turn left, turn left, jump].\n\nSo sequence:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT (from the first part)\n\nThen:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (first repetition)\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (second)\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (third)\n\nPutting all together:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no. Wait the first part is \"turn left\", which is a single action I_TURN_LEFT. Then after that, we have the thrice repetition of the \"jump opposite left\" which each time requires two turns left and a jump.\n\nWait, but after the initial turn left, we have to perform three times \"jump opposite left\", each of which is two left turns and a jump. But wait, after the first \"jump opposite left\", you have two left turns, then jump. Then the second time, you do another two left turns, then jump, etc.\n\nBut wait, the direction you're facing might be changing with each turn, but according to the rules, the semantic parsing is syntactic and not concerned with actual direction outcomes. So regardless of how the turns affect the direction, the actions are as per the parsing.\n\nSo the total sequence would be:\n\nFirst, I_TURN_LEFT (from the initial \"turn left\")\n\nThen:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (first \"jump opposite left\")\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (second)\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (third)\n\nWhich makes the entire sequence:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nWait, but wait. Let's count the number of actions:\n\nOriginal \"jump opposite left thrice\" would be each \"jump opposite left\" as three actions (two turns left, jump), thrice repeated: 3 * 3 = 9 actions.\n\nBut the initial \"turn left\" is one action. So total actions: 1 +9 = 10. Let's check:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT (1)\n\nthen:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (3 actions, total 4)\n\nthen again two turns and jump (total 6 more actions, total 1+3*3=10).\n\nWait, but the initial turn left is 1 action. Then the thrice part is 3 times (turn left, turn left, jump) = 3*3=9. So total 1+9=10 actions. So the entire output should be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, no. Wait, the initial \"turn left\" is done first. Then after that, the \"jump opposite left thrice\" is processed. So:\n\nThe first action is I_TURN_LEFT.\n\nThen, for each of the three times:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_JUMP.\n\nSo the entire sequence:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT (from \"turn left\")\n\nthen:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (1st)\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (2nd)\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (3rd)\n\nSo the total list would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nWhich is 1 + (3*3) = 10 actions.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo the final output would be a space-separated list of these actions.", "rationality_label": "Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The original command 'jump opposite left thrice after turn left' is parsed correctly according to the rules.

Hmm, first, I need to parse each part according to the rules.\n\nStarting with \"walk left\". Wait, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"walk left\" might be a bit confusing. Wait, rule 1 says that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. The primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"walk left\" isn't a primitive. Wait, maybe \"walk\" is the verb and \"left\" is a direction? But according to the rules, direction is part of the verb for turning. Wait, no. Wait, the primitives are individual verbs. So \"walk\" is one action, \"turn left\" is another. So \"walk left\" might not be a valid primitive. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake here? Or maybe I need to parse it as \"walk\" and \"left\" being a direction modifier. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the primitives are the ones listed. So \"walk\" is a primitive verb, and \"turn left\" is another. So \"walk left\" might be a command that's not a primitive. Wait, but the example input was \"jump around right\", which uses \"jump\" as the verb. So perhaps \"walk left\" is a verb followed by a direction, but according to the rules, direction modifiers like \"around\" or \"opposite\" are handled in the rules. Wait, perhaps \"walk left\" is equivalent to turning left and then walking? No, that's not according to the rules. Wait, the problem says that \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitives. So \"walk left\" isn't a primitive. So maybe the user meant \"turn left and walk\"? Or perhaps \"walk left\" is a typo, but since I have to process it, perhaps I need to parse it as \"walk\" and \"left\" as a direction modifier. Wait, but the example input uses \"jump around right\" which becomes multiple jumps and turns. So the structure is that a command can be a verb with modifiers. So maybe \"walk left\" is a verb followed by a direction modifier. Wait, but according to the rules, modifiers like \"around\" and \"opposite\" are used with directions. Let me re-read the rules.\n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" means two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no, the verb is preceded by the modifier. Wait, the example for \"opposite <DIR>\" would be like \"look opposite right\" meaning two turns right, then look. Rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"around\" applies to the verb that follows. Similarly, \"opposite\" applies to the verb that follows. So modifiers come before the verb. So in the given input, \"walk left\" is not using a modifier. Hmm. Wait, the input is \"walk left and look opposite right thrice\". So \"walk left\" might be a separate command. Wait, but according to the primitives, \"walk\" is a primitive verb, and \"turn left\" is a primitive. But \"walk left\" is not a primitive. So maybe the user intended \"walk\" and \"left\" as two separate actions? No, because \"walk left\" would be parsed as \"walk\" followed by \"left\", but \"left\" isn't a verb. Wait, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps \"left\" here is a direction, but the rules don't specify that other verbs take directions. Hmm. Wait, maybe \"walk left\" is a mistake, but according to the problem statement, I have to parse it. Alternatively, perhaps \"walk left\" is equivalent to \"turn left\" then \"walk\", but that's not stated in the rules. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps \"walk left\" is a typo and should be \"turn left and walk\", but according to the input's structure, the user wrote \"walk left and look opposite right thrice\". Let's check the structure. The main components are \"walk left\", \"look opposite right thrice\", connected by \"and\", which according to rule 5 means do A then B. So first do \"walk left\", then do \"look opposite right thrice\". But \"walk left\" is not a primitive verb. Wait, unless \"look\" is a primitive verb. Wait, the list of primitive verbs given in the rules are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Wait, the user didn't list \"look\" as a primitive verb. Oh, this is a problem. Wait, the example uses \"jump around right\" which maps to turn right and jump each time, but the problem statement says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\" and lists walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" is not a primitive verb here. Then how do we process \"look opposite right\"? Unless \"look\" is a primitive verb. But according to the rules as given, the primitive verbs don't include look. Wait, this is a problem. Wait, maybe the example has a jump, which is a primitive verb. So in the example, \"jump around right\" uses the verb \"jump\". But the current input has \"look opposite right thrice\". So if \"look\" is not a primitive verb, how do we handle it? This must be a mistake in the problem statement. Wait, perhaps the original user input intended that any verb is allowed, but mapped to uppercase. Wait, no. The rules say \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\", then list the primitives. So the primitives are only the ones listed. Therefore, \"look\" is not a primitive verb. Therefore, the input \"walk left and look opposite right thrice\" includes a verb that's not a primitive. But how to process this? Maybe it's a typo, and \"look\" should be \"walk\" or another primitive. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that any verb is allowed as long as it's in the input, but the rules only specify mappings for the listed primitives. But the example output uses the verb in uppercase. So perhaps the system is supposed to convert any verb to uppercase, even if not a primitive. Wait, but the first rule says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions: ...\". So perhaps non-primitive verbs are invalid. But then the input would be invalid, but we have to process it. Hmm. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo and should be \"jump\" or another primitive. But given that the input is as stated, perhaps we should proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a primitive verb. Or maybe it's a mistake, and the intended verb is \"turn left\" or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's example uses \"jump\", which is a primitive, but in this input, \"look\" is intended to be treated as a verb, but not a primitive. Wait, but according to the rules, only the listed primitives are mapped. So if \"look\" is not a primitive, then the command is invalid. However, the problem is expecting a valid output. Therefore, perhaps \"look\" is intended to be a verb, and we should map it to I_LOOK. Because the first rule says that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So if \"look\" is a verb, even if not listed as a primitive, perhaps we need to uppercase it. Wait, but the first rule says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions: walk→I_WALK, run→I_RUN, etc.\" So the mapping is only for the primitives listed. So if \"look\" is not a primitive, then it's not a valid verb. Therefore, the input may have a mistake here. However, given that the problem requires processing this input, perhaps the user intended \"look\" to be a primitive verb. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\". But without further information, I need to proceed with the assumption that the input is correct, and that \"look\" is a primitive verb. Otherwise, the problem would not have this input. So perhaps the problem's rule list is incomplete, and we should treat any verb as a primitive. So \"look\" becomes I_LOOK.\n\nAssuming that, then moving forward.\n\nSo the input is \"walk left and look opposite right thrice\".\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nFirst part: \"walk left\" — but according to the rules, \"walk\" is a verb, and \"left\" here may be a direction. Wait, but according to the rules, how is direction handled? The rules mention \"around <DIR>\" and \"opposite <DIR>\" where DIR is left or right. So \"left\" here may be part of a direction modifier. Wait, but \"walk left\" doesn't have a modifier like \"around\" or \"opposite\". Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, \"walk left\" could be parsed as \"walk\" followed by \"turn left\", but that's not according to the given rules. The rules don't mention that a direction after a verb implies a turn. So perhaps \"walk left\" is invalid. Alternatively, maybe \"walk left\" is supposed to be \"turn left then walk\", but again, there's no rule for that.\n\nWait, perhaps \"walk left\" is a mistake. Let's check the example again. The example input was \"jump around right\", which becomes a series of turns and jumps. So modifiers like \"around\" and \"opposite\" apply to verbs. So the structure of a command can be something like [modifier] [verb], but modifiers can be things like \"around left\", \"opposite right\", etc.\n\nIn the current input, \"walk left\" — \"left\" is a direction.

The input is \"jump around left thrice and look left thrice\". Hmm, first, I need to parse each part according to the rules.\n\nStarting with \"jump around left thrice\". The \"around left\" part means 4 repetitions of [turn left + jump]. So each around left would be I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP repeated four times. But then there's \"thrice\", which means the entire \"jump around left\" sequence is repeated three times. Wait, no. Wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"jump around left\" would be [I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP] x4. Then \"thrice\" applies to that entire around left sequence. Wait, no. Wait, \"jump around left thrice\" – the \"around left\" is four times, then \"thrice\" would mean that the whole around left is done three times? Or wait, the structure is \"jump around left\" which is one around left, and \"thrice\" applies to that verb. So \"jump around left thrice\" would be repeating the \"jump around left\" sequence three times.\n\nWait, rule 4: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 reps of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"jump around left\" becomes four times [turn left, jump]. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeat that entire sequence three times. Wait, no: \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"jump around left thrice\" would be the verb \"jump around left\" repeated three times. But \"jump around left\" itself is already a sequence of four [turn left + jump] pairs. So each time you do \"jump around left\", you do 4 steps, then doing that three times would be 12 steps.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me recheck. The example in the problem statement was \"jump around right\" becomes four [turn right then jump], then each around step is four actions. So the example output is four turns right and four jumps. So \"jump around right\" is four [turn right, jump], then turn right again? Wait, looking at the example:\n\nIN: jump around right → OUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times? Wait the example output is \"I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\". Wait, but wait, the example output shows three jumps and four turns? Wait, let me check. Wait, the example says:\n\nInput: jump around right\n\nOutput: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT ?\n\nWait, no, the example's output is written as:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times, but each repetition would be turn, jump, turn, jump, etc. But looking at the actual example:\n\nThe example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT ?\n\nWait, no, the example given is:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT ?\n\nWait, the example's output has four I_TURN_RIGHT and four I_JUMP. Wait, no: the output as given in the problem statement is:\n\nExample:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, wait, let me check again. The user wrote:\n\nExample:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, so the output has 4 I_TURN_RIGHT and 3 I_JUMP? Wait, no, looking at the actual output:\n\nThe output is written as:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP [space] I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, that would be three I_JUMPs and four I_TURN_RIGHTs. But how? Because \"around right\" is 4 repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So each repetition is turn right then jump. So four times that would be:\n\nturn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump. Then, after that, another turn right? No, wait, maybe the problem statement's example has a typo? Because according to rule 4, \"around <DIR>\" should be 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each rep is turn + verb, so four times. So for jump around right, it should be:\n\n[I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP] four times, so 4 turns and 4 jumps. But in the example output, it's written as:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated three times, then another I_TURN_RIGHT. So total of 4 turns and 3 jumps. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Maybe the example's output is a mistake, or perhaps the rule is different. Wait, perhaps the problem's example is correct. Let me re-examine the example.\n\nWait, the example input is \"jump around right\" and the output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nBreaking that down:\n\nEach line is:\n\nTurn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right.\n\nThat's four turns and three jumps. So that's three times the pair (turn and jump), then a final turn. But according to rule 4, \"around <DIR>\" should be four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So four times. Then that example would have four turns and four jumps. But the example output has three jumps. So there's a discrepancy here. Which suggests that maybe rule 4 is not as I thought.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem's example is correct, so I must have misunderstood the rule. Let me re-read the rule 4.\n\nRule 4: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb].\n\nAh, okay. So each repetition is a turn DIR followed by the verb. So four times. So for \"jump around right\", the four repetitions would be:\n\nturn right, jump → repeated four times. So total of four turns and four jumps.\n\nBut the example output shows:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated thrice and then a final I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nWait, in the example output:\n\nEach of the first three times: turn right, jump. Then after that, another turn right. So:\n\nTotal actions: [turn, jump] ×3, then turn.\n\nWhich would make four turns and three jumps. Which contradicts the rule. So this suggests that either the rule or the example is wrong, but more likely, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the example.\n\nWait, perhaps the example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP four times, followed by I_TURN_RIGHT? Wait, no. Let's count the example's output:\n\nThe example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSplit into tokens separated by spaces:\n\n1. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\n2. I_JUMP\n\n3. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\n4. I_JUMP\n\n5. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\n6. I_JUMP\n\n7. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSo total of 7 tokens: 4 turns, 3 jumps.\n\nHmm. So according to this, the example output has 4 turns and 3 jumps. But according to rule 4, \"around right\" should be four repetitions. So each repetition is [turn, jump], four times → four turns and four jumps. So why the example output is different?\n\nAh, perhaps the problem has a mistake here. Or perhaps the actual rule is that around DIR is four turns and the verb after each. But the example shows three jumps and four turns, which would be three times the pair, then a fourth turn. Which doesn't align with the rule. Alternatively, maybe the example is a typo, and the correct output should be four jumps and four turns.\n\nBut regardless, we have to follow the example. Because the user provided the example, and the rules. So perhaps the example is correct. Wait, the example input \"jump around right\" → four repetitions of [turn right + jump], then another turn right?\n\nNo, the output in the example is 4 turns and 3 jumps. So perhaps the rule is not exactly as stated. Wait, let me re-read the rules:\n\nRule 4: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb].\n\nAh, okay. So each repetition is a turn followed by the verb. So each repetition is two actions. So four repetitions would be eight actions? Or wait, the verb is the action. Wait, the primitive verbs map to uppercase actions, so \"jump\" becomes I_JUMP.\n\nSo \"jump around right\" would be parsed as the verb \"jump around right\", which is \"around right\" modifying the verb \"jump\".\n\nThus, according to rule 4, the verb becomes four repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So each repetition is two actions. So four times → 8 actions total. But the example output has 7 actions. So perhaps the example is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the final turn is omitted. Hmm.\n\nIn the example, \"jump around right\" → output is seven tokens. So perhaps the rule is that after the four jumps, you don't end with the fourth turn. But according to the example, they do the four turns. Hmm. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is wrong, but we have to follow the rules. So regardless of the example, perhaps the correct approach is to process according to the rules.\n\nSo for this problem, I need to follow the rules, and the", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The initial breakdown correctly applies the grammar rules.

The input is \"run left twice and walk around right thrice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part of this command according to the given rules. Let's split it into two main parts: \"run left twice\" and \"walk around right thrice\", connected by \"and\". According to rule 5, \"A and B\" means do A then B in order. So I'll process each part separately and then combine them.\n\nStarting with \"run left twice\". The phrase \"run left\" could be interpreted as running in the left direction. However, according to the primitive verbs listed, the actions are I_RUN, I_TURN_LEFT, etc. Wait, the primitive verbs are the base actions. So \"run left\" might actually be a direction, but looking at the rules, \"opposite <DIR>\" and \"around <DIR>\" are specific. Wait, the first rule says that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So \"run left\" isn't a primitive verb. Hmm, perhaps \"run\" is a verb, and \"left\" is a direction modifier. Wait, but the example shows \"jump around right\" becomes four turns right and jumps each time. So \"around right\" is a modifier on the verb.\n\nWait, maybe each command is a verb followed by possible modifiers. Let's parse the input as follows:\n\nOriginal input: \"run left twice and walk around right thrice\"\n\nSplit into two parts connected by \"and\". Let's process each part:\n\nFirst part: \"run left twice\"\n\nWait, \"run left\" – does that mean turning left and then running? Or is \"left\" a direction modifier? According to the rules, \"opposite <DIR>\" and \"around <DIR>\" are modifiers. So perhaps \"run left\" isn't a primitive verb, so we have to see if \"left\" is part of the turn command. Wait, the primitive verbs include turn left and turn right. So \"run\" is a verb, and \"left\" might be a direction modifier. But how does that fit into the rules?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"run left\" is equivalent to \"run\" after \"turn left\", but that's not a rule. Wait, the example in the rules is \"jump around right\" which becomes four repetitions of turn right then jump. So the structure is verb around dir.\n\nSimilarly, \"run left\" might not be a standard modifier. Wait, perhaps \"run left\" is a mistake, and the user intended \"turn left then run\", but according to the rules, how to parse \"run left twice\"?\n\nWait, maybe \"run left\" is using the left direction as a modifier. But looking at the rules, the modifiers are \"opposite <DIR>\", \"around <DIR>\", and then repetition with \"twice\", \"thrice\". So perhaps \"run left\" isn't a modifier, but \"left\" here is a direction. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake, but according to the given rules, how to parse this?\n\nWait, the input is \"run left twice\". Let's check if \"left\" is part of a rule. Rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\", which would be \"opposite left\", but that's not in the input. Rule 3: \"around <DIR>\". So the first part is \"run left\", which doesn't fit those modifiers. So perhaps \"run left\" is not a valid modifier, but the user might have intended \"run (to the) left\", which would require turning left, then running. However, according to the rules, how do we handle that? The problem is that the input might have a command that isn't covered by the rules. Wait, but the example uses \"jump around right\", so modifiers like \"around\" are applied to the verb. So perhaps \"run left\" is not a valid command here. Wait, but the input is \"run left twice\". Maybe the user intended \"run left\" as a command, but according to the primitive verbs listed, \"run\" is a verb, and \"left\" is a direction, but the primitive verbs don't include moving left. Wait, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So the only way to move directionally is to turn first, then move. But the agent's movement actions (like I_WALK, I_RUN, I_JUMP) don't have direction parameters. So perhaps \"run left\" would be interpreted as turning left, then running? Or is \"run left\" a mistake?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, we need to process the command according to the rules. Let's re-examine the input. Wait, perhaps the input is \"run left twice\", which might be parsed as \"run\" followed by \"left twice\", but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a typo, but given that the user wrote it, we have to find a way to parse it.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended \"run\" as the verb and \"left\" as a direction modifier. But according to the given rules, direction modifiers are \"opposite <DIR>\" and \"around <DIR>\". So \"run left\" isn't covered by the rules. Hmm. This is a problem. Maybe the input has a mistake, but assuming that the rules are complete, how to parse \"run left\"?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a misunderstanding of \"turn left then run\", but according to the rules, how would that be phrased? The user might have meant \"run to the left\", which would require turning left, then running. But according to the rules, how would that be expressed? The rules don't specify directional movement, only turning. So perhaps \"run left\" is invalid, but since the user provided the input, we need to find a way. Maybe the user intended \"run\" followed by \"turn left\", but that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a way to say \"run in the left direction\", which would require turning left first. But according to the rules, how to parse this?\n\nWait, perhaps the input is written in a way that \"run left\" is equivalent to \"run opposite left\" or something else. But that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in omitting \"around\" or \"opposite\", but in that case, we have to process according to the rules. Let's check the problem again.\n\nThe user's input is \"run left twice and walk around right thrice\"\n\nWait, perhaps \"run left\" here is a typo for \"turn left\", but the user wrote \"run left\". Alternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a command to move left, but according to the primitives, there's no such command. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So movement is forward, but direction is controlled by turning. So the correct way to go left would be to turn left, then move. So \"run left\" would be ambiguous. However, according to the rules, how should this be parsed?\n\nGiven that the rules don't have a way to handle \"run left\", perhaps the problem expects us to interpret \"run left\" as \"run\" followed by \"turn left\"? But that's not a rule. Alternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a mistake, but given that it's the input, we have to work with it. Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a misphrasing and the intended command is \"turn left then run\", but how to parse that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"left\" here is a typo for \"west\" or another direction, but the problem uses left and right as directions.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is \"run left twice\" meaning \"run in the left direction twice\", which would require turning left once and then running twice. Or maybe \"run left\" is a compound command. But according to the given rules, there's no mapping for moving left; movement is forward, and direction is changed by turning.\n\nSo perhaps the correct way to parse \"run left\" is to ignore the left part, but that can't be. The user must have intended something else. Alternatively, maybe \"left\" here is part of a different structure. Wait, the rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"opposite right\" would be two right turns, then the verb. So maybe \"run left\" is not a standard modifier, but the user wrote \"run left twice\" as \"run twice and left twice\", which is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a typo for \"turn left\", but the input is as given.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects that \"run left\" is parsed as \"turn left\" followed by \"run\", and the \"twice\" applies to both. Let's consider that.\n\nSo \"run left twice\" would be interpreted as \"run left\" twice, which would be \"turn left run\" twice, but how?\n\nWait, according to the rules, \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of turn DIR + verb. Similarly, \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb.\n\nBut for other directions, perhaps \"run left\" would be a shorthand for turning left and then running. But according to the rules, there's no such rule. Therefore, maybe the input \"run left\" is invalid, but since it's part of the problem, perhaps the user intended \"run\" to be followed by a direction modifier which isn't covered by the existing rules. But in that case, how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the input, but we need to proceed. Let's think differently. Maybe the \"run left\" in the input is a mistake and should be \"run around left\", but given the input, perhaps we should proceed", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 92, "model_reflection": "The original parsing followed the rules consistently.

So the entire \"look thrice\" is B, and \"run right\" is A. So the order is B then A.\n\nBut wait, \"look thrice\" means repeat the look action three times. But what's the base action for \"look\"? The user didn't mention a primitive verb \"look\", but according to the rules, primitive verbs are mapped to uppercase actions. Wait, the rules list the primitives as walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" isn't among them. Hmm. Wait, the user provided rules. Let me check again:\n\nRule 1 lists the primitive verbs as walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, maybe \"look\" is not a valid command. But the input has \"look thrice\". That's confusing. Wait, the problem says \"process this command\", so perhaps \"look\" is a typo or maybe there's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user intended \"look\" as a primitive verb, but it's not in the initial list. Wait, perhaps the example uses \"jump around right\", which uses jump, which is in the list. Hmm. So if the input is \"run right after look thrice\", but \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, then how to handle that?\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again. The problem says \"semantic parsing agent for navigation commands\" and lists the primitive verbs. So according to the rules, only those primitives are allowed. Therefore, \"look\" isn't a valid verb. Is the input invalid? But the user is asking to process it. Maybe there's a typo, and \"look\" should be \"walk\"? Or perhaps \"look\" is supposed to be a turn action?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" here is considered a typo and should be \"turn left\" or \"turn right\". But how to proceed. Hmm. Wait, the problem might have a typo, but given that the example uses \"jump around right\" which works, perhaps the user intended \"look\" to be a valid action. But according to the given rules, it's not. So this is a problem. But since the user provided the input, perhaps we should proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a primitive verb, even if it's not listed. Or maybe the user intended \"look\" to be a turn command. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a mistake for \"walk\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" here refers to turning in a direction, but the rules don't mention it. Hmm. This is a problem because the rules don't include \"look\". But the user is asking to process this command. Let's assume that \"look\" is a valid primitive verb, even if not listed. So \"look\" would map to I_LOOK. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is meant to be a turn, but the rules don't specify that. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the command should be \"turn left\", but that's not certain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"run right\" is a direction. Wait, \"run right\" could mean turn right and then run. Wait, according to rule 1, \"turn left\" maps to I_TURN_LEFT. So \"run right\" might be a direction. Wait, the rules don't mention directions except in the phrases \"opposite <DIR>\", \"around <DIR>\", etc. So perhaps \"run right\" is not a valid command. Wait, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"run\" is a verb, and \"right\" as a direction. Wait, but the verb \"run\" is separate from turning. So \"run right\" is ambiguous. Wait, but according to the rules, \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitives. But \"run\" is a primitive verb. However, the input is \"run right\", which could be a way to say \"run in the right direction\", but according to the rules, how is that parsed?\n\nWait, the problem here is that the user's input is \"run right after look thrice\". Let's first split into \"run right\" and \"look thrice\". But according to the rules, \"run\" is a primitive verb. But \"right\" is a direction, perhaps. Wait, but the primitive verbs are turn left and turn right. So \"run right\" isn't a primitive verb. So how to parse that?\n\nHmm. Wait, maybe \"run right\" is a command to turn right and then run. But according to the rules, how is that expressed. For example, \"run opposite left\" would be two left turns then run, per rule 2. So perhaps \"run right\" isn't a valid command, unless \"right\" is a direction modifier. Alternatively, perhaps \"run right\" is a mistake and should be \"turn right then run\". But the input is \"run right\", so perhaps the user intended to run in the right direction, which may require turning first.\n\nBut according to the rules, how is that expressed? The rules don't mention moving in directions beyond the turning. So perhaps to run to the right, you need to turn right then run. But the problem is that \"run right\" isn't a standard command here. So perhaps \"run right\" is a misphrase and should be \"turn right and run\" or something. However, given that the input is as is, how to parse?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"run right\" is a mistake, and the correct command is \"turn right and run\", but the input is \"run right after look thrice\".\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, according to the rules, the structure of the input is \"run right after look thrice\", which is \"A after B\", so B then A. So B is \"look thrice\", and A is \"run right\".\n\nNow, \"look thrice\" means repeat the look verb three times. So assuming \"look\" is a verb, which would map to I_LOOK. So the sequence for B is I_LOOK I_LOOK I_LOOK.\n\nThen A is \"run right\". Now, \"run\" is a primitive verb, but what does \"right\" here mean? If \"run right\" is a direction, perhaps we need to turn right first and then run. But according to the rules, how is that expressed? For example, in the example, \"jump around right\" is 4 repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So combining a turn and a verb.\n\nSo \"run right\" could be interpreted as turn right then run. But how is that phrasing? The original rules don't explicitly explain that. The problem is that \"run right\" isn't a primitive verb. So maybe the intended parsing is \"turn right then run\", which would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"run right\" is an error, but given that we need to parse it, perhaps we need to apply some logic. But according to the rules, the only primitive verbs are the ones listed. So \"run\" is a verb. The direction \"right\" could be part of a turn. But how to get \"run right\" into the allowed actions.\n\nWait, maybe \"run right\" is equivalent to \"run opposite left\" (rule 2), but that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, \"run right\" could be a single action, but the rules don't have a mapping. Hmm.\n\nThis seems like a problem. The user's input contains \"run right\" and \"look\", neither of which are primitive verbs. Unless \"look\" is a typo. Let's think again.\n\nWait, in the example, the input \"jump around right\" outputs a sequence of turn right and jump four times. So \"around right\" uses the rule 3, which is four times [turn right + jump]. So the verb here is jump.\n\nSo the structure of the command is usually a verb plus modifiers. So \"run right\" could be a direction modifier. But according to the rules, \"opposite <DIR>\" and \"around <DIR>\" are modifiers. But \"run right\" isn't using those. So perhaps \"run right\" is not a valid command. Alternatively, maybe the input has a typo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended \"turn right\" as part of the run. For example, \"run opposite left\" would be two left turns then run. But \"run right\" is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run right\" is a mistake, and the intended command is \"turn right then run\", which would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN.\n\nSimilarly, \"look\" is not a primitive verb. So perhaps this input is invalid. However, the problem asks to process it, so maybe \"look\" is intended to be a valid primitive verb (maybe the user forgot to list it in the rules?), and maps to I_LOOK. Then \"look thrice\" would be I_LOOK repeated three times.\n\nAssuming that, then:\n\nThe input \"run right after look thrice\" is parsed as:\n\nFirst do \"look thrice\", then do \"run right\".\n\nSo the entire sequence would be:\n\n[look thrice] [run right]\n\nAssuming \"look thrice\" → I_LOOK I_LOOK I_LOOK\n\n\"run right\" → but according to rules, what does \"run right\" mean?

The user wants me to process \"run opposite left twice after turn opposite left\". Hmm, first, I need to break down each part according to the rules provided.\n\nStarting with \"turn opposite left\". According to rule 2, \"opposite left\" means two turns in the left direction. So turning left twice. So that part would be I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT. Got that.\n\nNow the other part is \"run opposite left twice\". Wait, the structure here might be a bit tricky. Let's parse it. \"run opposite left\" first. Using rule 2 again, opposite left is two left turns, then the verb. So \"run opposite left\" would be two left turns followed by a run. So that's I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN. Then \"twice\" applies to that entire sequence. Rule 4 says \"twice\" means repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, no, rule 4 says \"twice\" repeats the verb sequence twice. Wait, rule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So in this case, \"run opposite left\" is the verb sequence, and \"twice\" would make that sequence happen twice. Wait, no. Wait, the original command is \"run opposite left twice after turn opposite left\". Let me re-read the entire command.\n\nThe full command is: run opposite left twice after turn opposite left. Breaking it down: The main structure is \"A after B\", where A is \"run opposite left twice\" and B is \"turn opposite left\". According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So first B (turn opposite left), then A (run opposite left twice).\n\nSo first, process B: turn opposite left. As rule 2 says, two turns left: I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT.\n\nThen process A: run opposite left twice. Let's parse \"run opposite left\" first. Opposite left is two left turns, then the verb. So run opposite left would be: I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN. Then \"twice\" applies to this entire sequence. Rule 4 says \"twice\" means repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, rule 4 says \"twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So the verb here is \"run opposite left\", which itself is a sequence. Therefore, doing that twice. Wait, but how does the \"twice\" apply? Let me check the rules again.\n\nRule 4: \"A and B\" = do A then B. Rule 5. Rule 6: \"A after B\" = do B then A. Rule 4 about \"twice\": the verb sequence is the entire phrase before \"twice\"? So if the command is \"run opposite left twice\", then \"run opposite left\" is the verb sequence, which is done twice. So each time, you do two left turns and then run. Then repeat that entire sequence again. So \"run opposite left\" once is I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN. Twice would be that sequence twice. So I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN.\n\nPutting it all together: the entire command is \"run opposite left twice after turn opposite left\", which translates to B then A. B is turn opposite left (I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT), then A is run opposite left twice (the sequence twice). So combining them: I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT [then] I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the B is \"turn opposite left\", which is two left turns. Then A is \"run opposite left twice\", which is run opposite left two times. So each time \"run opposite left\" is done twice. So each instance of \"run opposite left\" is two left turns plus a run. Therefore, the entire A sequence is two times (two left turns + run). So the A part would be: [I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN] repeated twice, which would be I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN.\n\nThen the entire command would be B followed by A: B is I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT, then A is I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN. So combined, the total sequence would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT (B) followed by I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN (A). \n\nWait, but does that make sense? Let me check again.\n\nOriginal command: run opposite left twice after turn opposite left.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n\"A after B\" → B then A. So B is \"turn opposite left\" (I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT). A is \"run opposite left twice\" (so run opposite left two times).\n\nEach \"run opposite left\" is two left turns and a run. So each run opposite left is:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, the \"run opposite left\" is the verb sequence. According to rule 2, \"opposite left\" is two turns left, then the verb. Wait, the rule says: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, wait. Wait, rule 2 says that \"opposite <DIR>\" is equivalent to two turns in DIR direction, then the verb. Wait, no. Wait, rule 2 says: \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR, then the verb. Wait, the example given in the problem is \"jump around right\" becomes four [turn right + jump] steps, which aligns with rule 3. So rule 2: if you have \"opposite <DIR>\", then you do two turns in DIR direction, then the verb. Wait, but how does that apply to the verb?\n\nWait, for example, if the command is \"run opposite left\", then according to rule 2, \"opposite left\" would be two turns left (since DIR is left), then the verb. Wait, but the verb is run. So does that mean that the sequence is two left turns, then run? Or two left turns, then turn again (since the verb is directional?) Or wait, the primitive verbs map to actions. So \"run\" is a movement action, not a turn. So \"run opposite left\" would be: the direction to run is opposite left. But according to rule 2, the way to handle \"opposite <DIR>\" is to do two turns in DIR, then the verb. So in this case, the command is to run in the opposite left direction, which requires turning left twice (to face the opposite direction of left, which is right?), and then run? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding this.\n\nWait, perhaps \"opposite left\" means facing the opposite direction of left, which would be right. But according to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR direction, then the verb. So for example, \"turn opposite left\" would be two left turns (each 90 degrees left, so total 180 degrees) then turn (but wait, the verb here would be turn? That seems conflicting. Wait, in the example given in the rules, perhaps not. Wait, in the example, \"jump around right\" uses rule 3. But let's take the example from the user's example:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nWait, no, the output in the example is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP ?\n\nWait, no, the user's example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, wait, the example input is \"jump around right\". Rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is turn DIR then verb. So four times. So each time, you turn right then jump. So four times. But each turn DIR is a single turn, right? So four times:\n\nTurn right, jump\n\nTurn right, jump\n\nTurn right, jump\n\nTurn right, jump\n\nWhich would result in four I_TURN_RIGHT and four I_JUMP, alternating. So the output would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times. But the example output given is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT \n\nWait, that's three jumps and four turns? That doesn't fit. Wait, the example output the user gave is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, which is 4 turns and 3 jumps. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the rule.\n\nWait, the example input is \"jump around right\", and the output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT \n\nSo four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP. Let's count the elements:\n\nTurn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right. So four turns and three jumps. So that's three repetitions of [turn right + jump], then a final turn right. Wait, but according to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So four times turn DIR and verb. Which would be four turns and four verbs. So the example seems to not fit. Unless there's a mistake in the example.

The input is \"run left after jump around left thrice\". Hmm, first I need to parse the structure. According to the rules, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So here, \"run left\" is A and \"jump around left thrice\" is B. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is \"run left after [jump around left thrice]\". So the entire \"jump around left thrice\" comes first, then the \"run left\". So the order is B then A, where B is \"jump around left thrice\" and A is \"run left\".\n\nFirst, process \"jump around left thrice\". Breaking it down: \"around left\" means 4 repetitions of [turn left + jump]. Then \"thrice\" means repeat that entire around left sequence three times. Wait, wait. Wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"jump around left\" would be expanding to 4 times [turn left + jump]. Then \"thrice\" says to repeat that entire \"around left\" three times. Because \"around left\" itself is a sequence of actions. So \"around left\" is 4 repetitions of [turn left + jump], and doing that thrice would be repeating that 4-repetition three times. So \"jump around left thrice\" becomes 3 times (4 repetitions of [turn left + jump]).\n\nLet me write that out. Each around left is:\n\nturn left, jump, turn left, jump, turn left, jump, turn left, jump.\n\nSo four times [turn left + jump], which is four turns left and four jumps. Then doing that thrice would be 3*4=12 jumps and 12 turns left? Wait, no. No, each around is a block. So each \"around left\" is a block of 4 repetitions of [turn left, jump]. So each around is 4 turns left and 4 jumps. Then \"thrice\" would repeat that entire block three times. So total of 3 * 4 = 12 jumps and 12 turns left.\n\nWait, no, no. Wait, no, the \"around left\" is the block of four [turn left + jump]. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeat the entire around left three times. So the entire around left (which is four [turn left + jump]) is done three times. So the total sequence would be:\n\naround left thrice → 3 times (turn left jump turn left jump turn left jump turn left jump)\n\nSo each around left is four steps, three times that would be 12 steps. So each time you do the four steps, then again three times. Wait, but \"around left\" is already four steps. So \"around left thrice\" is 3 times the entire around left sequence. Hmm, but maybe \"around left\" is the same as \"around <DIR>\" which is four [turn DIR + verb], so each around is four steps. Then \"around left thrice\" would be \"around left\" done three times? Or wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Then rule 4 also says that \"verb twice\" is repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, rule 4 says: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice; similarly for thrice. Wait, no, rule 4: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"around\" is a different construct than \"twice\" or \"thrice\". So in this case, \"jump around left thrice\" is parsed as \"jump around left\" done thrice. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the original input is \"jump around left thrice\". Wait, in the given example, \"jump around right\" becomes 4 repetitions of [turn right + jump], so four turns and jumps. Now, the current case is \"jump around left thrice\". So \"around left\" is four [turn left + jump], then \"thrice\" would mean that the entire \"around left\" is done three times? Or is \"jump around left\" the entire action, and \"thrice\" applies to that. So \"jump around left\" is the verb sequence, which is four [turn left + jump], and \"thrice\" would repeat that four-step sequence three times. Wait, but according to rule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"jump around left\" is a verb sequence. Wait, perhaps not. Hmm, this part is confusing.\n\nWait, let's look at the rules again. Rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"jump around right\" is four times [turn right + jump], as in the example. Rule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"jump twice\" would be jump jump, but if the verb sequence is more complex, like \"jump around left\", then \"jump around left twice\" would be repeat the entire jump around left sequence twice.\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump around left thrice\" is equivalent to the verb sequence \"jump around left\", which itself is 4 repetitions, then \"thrice\" says repeat that thrice. So the entire around action is done thrice. Wait, but no. Wait, according to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" expands to 4 repetitions. So \"jump around left\" becomes [turn left jump turn left jump turn left jump turn left jump]. Then \"thrice\" would repeat that entire sequence three times. Because rule 4 says that \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"jump around left\" is a verb, and \"thrice\" would repeat it thrice. So \"jump around left thrice\" would be three times the sequence of \"jump around left\".\n\nWait, but \"jump around left\" is already a sequence of actions (4 times the [turn dir + verb]). So \"jump around left thrice\" would be doing that entire 4x sequence three times. So the total would be 3 * 4 * (turn left jump) ?\n\nYes. So each \"around left\" is four [turn left + jump], then \"thrice\" would make that repeated three times. So total of 3 * 4 = 12 jumps and 12 turns left.\n\nSo the \"jump around left thrice\" would expand to:\n\n(turn left jump) *4 repeated thrice.\n\nWhich would be:\n\nturn left jump turn left jump turn left jump turn left jump (this is once around left)\n\nthen again the same four steps, then again same four steps, three times total.\n\nSo the entire sequence for \"jump around left thrice\" is 3 * 4 * [turn left jump].\n\nNow, moving back to the original command: \"run left after jump around left thrice\". According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So here, A is \"run left\" and B is \"jump around left thrice\". So first process B, then process A.\n\nProcessing A: \"run left\". According to rule 1, \"run\" maps to I_RUN. But what about \"left\"? Wait, \"run left\" would be a direction. Wait, but the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"run left\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, wait. Wait, the user input says \"run left\". Wait, according to the rules, the primitive verbs are the ones listed. So \"run\" is a primitive verb. What about \"run left\"? How is that parsed?\n\nWait, the command is \"run left after jump around left thrice\". Hmm, perhaps \"run left\" here is being parsed as a direction. Wait, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"run\" is a verb, but \"run left\" would be a different construct. Wait, no. Wait, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are the only directional verbs. So \"run left\" is not a primitive verb. That suggests that maybe the input is invalid, but according to the problem statement, I need to parse it.\n\nWait, perhaps \"run left\" is equivalent to turning left and then running? But the rules don't mention direction in the run. Hmm, this is a problem. Let me check the rules again.\n\nRule 1 says: Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"run left\" is not a primitive verb. So \"run left\" must be parsed using the other rules. Let's see. How to parse \"run left\"? Maybe \"left\" here is a direction modifier. Wait, but according to the given rules, perhaps \"run left\" would be parsed as \"turn left then run\"? Or maybe \"opposite left then run\"? Hmm, but the rules don't directly address that.\n\nWait, perhaps \"run left\" isn't covered by the rules. Wait, but maybe the command structure is ambiguous. Let's think again. The original example: \"jump around right\" becomes the 4 repetitions. So \"around\" applies to the verb. So perhaps the structure is verb with modifiers.\n\nWait, perhaps \"run left\" is equivalent to \"turn left and run\", but according to the rules, how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a mistake and should be \"turn left and run\", but the user input is \"run left\", so we", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The original parsing correctly follows the rules.

The input is \"turn opposite right twice after jump around right twice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part according to the rules. Let's start with the two main parts connected by \"after\". According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So the structure here is: [jump around right twice] is B, and [turn opposite right twice] is A. So the overall order is B first, then A.\n\nLet's tackle B first: \"jump around right twice\". Breaking this down, \"around right\" means 4 repetitions of [turn right + jump], as per rule 3. Then \"twice\" means repeating that entire \"around right\" sequence twice. Wait, wait. Wait, rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" is repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"jump around right twice\" would be: first parse \"jump around right\" as a single verb, then apply \"twice\" to it. Wait, but \"around right\" is modifying \"jump\", so \"jump around right\" is the verb. Then \"twice\" applies to that whole verb. So \"jump around right twice\" would be equivalent to doing \"jump around right\" twice. Let's confirm.\n\nRule 3: \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"jump around right\" would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated 4 times. Wait, no. Wait, the structure for \"around right\" is that each iteration is turn right then the verb. So \"jump around right\" is 4 times [I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP]. So the sequence would be: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP. Then \"twice\" would repeat this entire sequence twice? Wait, no. Wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"jump around right\" is four repetitions of [turn right + jump], so the first part is 4 times (I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP). Then \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. Wait, the verb here is \"jump around right\", so \"jump around right twice\" would mean repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions. Then \"twice\" would add another repetition. Wait, but how does the nesting work? Let's parse \"jump around right twice\". \n\nBreaking it down: The main verb is \"jump\", modified by \"around right\" and \"twice\". According to the rules, \"around right\" is rule 3, which transforms the verb into four repetitions of turn right plus the verb. Then \"twice\" (rule 4) would mean repeat that entire \"around right\" sequence twice. Wait, no. Wait, rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"jump around right\" is a verb modified by \"around right\". So \"jump around right\" becomes a sequence of four [turn right + jump]. Then \"twice\" would mean doing that sequence twice. Wait, but \"around right\" already expands to four steps. So \"jump around right twice\" would be (four steps of turn right + jump) repeated twice? So that's 8 steps of turn right and jump alternated?\n\nWait, no. Wait, \"jump around right\" is four repetitions of [turn right + jump], so each time you turn right then jump, four times. So the sequence is: turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump. Then \"twice\" would mean doing that entire \"jump around right\" sequence twice. So that would be 4*2=8 repetitions of turn right + jump. Wait, but the \"twice\" applies to the entire verb sequence. Wait, the verb here is \"jump around right\", which is a single verb sequence. So \"jump around right twice\" would be the sequence of \"jump around right\" done twice. Since \"around right\" already causes four repetitions, doing that twice would make it 4*2=8 times? That seems correct.\n\nSo B is \"jump around right twice\", which would be:\n\nFor each \"jump around right\", we have four [turn right, jump], so first time:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated 4 times: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP.\n\nThen \"twice\" would repeat that again. So the entire B part is that sequence repeated twice. So B is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (first around right)\n\nthen again the same sequence again (twice), so total 8 turns right and 4 jumps?\n\nWait, no, each around right has 4 jumps and 4 turns right. Wait, each around right has 4 turns right and 4 jumps. Then twice would make two of those blocks. So B is two blocks of four turns and jumps.\n\nSo B is:\n\n[I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP] *4 repeated twice. So the entire B part is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP.\n\nWait, but that's 8 turns and 8 jumps? Or wait, no. Each around right is four [turn right then jump], so four turns right and four jumps. Then \"twice\" would make that entire sequence repeated twice, which would be 8 turns right and 8 jumps? But the structure is each around right followed by twice. Hmm.\n\nOkay, moving on. Now the A part is \"turn opposite right twice\". Let's parse that. \"turn opposite right\" is rule 2: two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, the example is \"opposite right\" would be two turns right then the verb. Wait, but the verb here is \"turn\". Wait, wait. Wait, the input here is \"turn opposite right twice\". Let's parse this.\n\nThe phrase \"turn opposite right\" uses rule 2. \"opposite right\" means two turns in the opposite direction. Wait, no. Rule 2 says: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, the example would be \"walk opposite left\" would be two turns left then walk. Wait, but how does that work here. So the phrase here is \"turn opposite right\". So the verb is \"turn\", and the direction is modified by \"opposite right\". Wait, but \"turn\" is the primitive verb, which maps to I_TURN_LEFT or I_TURN_RIGHT. Wait, the original rule 1 says primitive verbs map to uppercase actions, so \"turn left\" → I_TURN_LEFT, \"turn right\" → I_TURN_RIGHT. So \"turn opposite right\" would be interpreted as follows: according to rule 2, \"opposite right\" means two turns in the DIR (right) then the verb. Wait, the verb here is \"turn\", but \"turn\" requires a direction. Wait, this part is confusing. Let me re-examine rule 2.\n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb.\n\nWait, so if the command is \"walk opposite left\", then this would be two turns left then walk. So the \"opposite\" here is a direction modifier that replaces the direction. So in the current example, \"turn opposite right\": the verb is \"turn\" with direction modified by \"opposite right\". So the original verb would be \"turn\" in a certain direction, but \"opposite right\" changes it to turning right twice (two turns in DIR (right)) then the verb. Wait, but the verb here is \"turn\", so what exactly happens? Because \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are separate actions. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps \"turn opposite right\" is equivalent to turning left, but according to rule 2, it's two turns in DIR (right), then the verb. Wait, but the original verb would have a direction. Wait, maybe \"turn opposite right\" means that instead of doing the verb (turning in some direction), you do two turns right, then perform the verb. Wait, but the verb here is \"turn\", but how is the direction determined?\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Wait, perhaps the structure is that \"turn opposite right\" is parsed as \"opposite right\" modifying the verb \"turn\". The rule says that \"opposite <DIR>\" becomes two turns in DIR then the verb. So in this case, the verb is \"turn\", but the direction is modified. Wait, perhaps the original direction intended is opposite of right, which is left, but according to the rule, it's two turns right then the verb. Wait, but that's the rule. So regardless of the direction, \"opposite right\" means two turns right then the verb. So if you have \"turn opposite right\", you first do two turns right, then do the verb. Wait, but the verb here is \"turn\", but in what direction?\n\nAh, this is confusing. Let's take the example given. The input here is \"turn opposite right twice\". Let's parse \"turn opposite right\" first. According to rule 2, this would be two turns right, then the verb. But what is the verb here? The verb is \"turn\", but direction needs to be determined. Maybe \"opposite\" replaces the direction. Wait, perhaps \"turn opposite right\" is equivalent to", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 60, "model_reflection": "Upon re-evaluation, the interpretation of 'turn opposite right' was incorrectly expanded.

Instead, 'turn opposite right' should mean 'two turns right, then turn right again' (i.e., I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT).

The input is \"turn around right and run right twice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part. Starting with \"turn around right\". According to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" means 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb is \"turn\", so it should be four times turning right and then turning again? Wait, wait. Wait, the original verb here is \"turn around right\". Wait, \"around right\" is the modifier. Let me check the rules again.\n\nRule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" equals 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. The verb here would be the action specified. Wait, in the example given, \"jump around right\" becomes four turns right followed by jumps. Wait, no: the example for \"jump around right\" is I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times. Wait, looking at the example: the output for \"jump around right\" is four instances of I_TURN_RIGHT followed by I_JUMP. Wait, actually, the example output is four turns and four jumps. Wait, the example input is \"jump around right\", which maps to \"4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]\". So each repetition is turn right then jump. So four times: turn right, jump, turn right, jump, etc. So the example output is I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP four times, which would be 4 turns and 4 jumps. So in that case, \"around\" applies to the verb, which is jump. \n\nSo in the current problem, \"turn around right\" would be the verb \"turn\" modified by \"around right\". Wait, but \"turn around right\" is the phrase. Wait, the original command starts with \"turn around right\". Hmm. Wait, \"turn around right\" could be parsed as \"turn around\" in the right direction, but according to the rules, \"around <DIR>\" is a modifier. So \"around right\" would mean that each step in the around is turn right and then the verb. Wait, but the verb here is \"turn left or right\"? Wait, maybe \"turn around right\" is parsed as \"turn (around right)\", where \"around right\" modifies the turn. But according to the rules, \"around <DIR>\" would indicate that the action is done around in that direction. Wait, but the primitive verbs are things like turn left/right. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the original command \"turn around right\" is a bit ambiguous. Wait, but according to the rules, the parsing should be done using the given rules. Let's re-examine the rules.\n\nRule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the verb here is the main action. Wait, but \"turn around right\" would be \"around right\" modifying the verb \"turn\". Wait, but the verb \"turn\" alone would need to be modified. Wait, but if the verb is \"turn left\", then how would \"around right\" apply? Hmm. Maybe the original phrase \"turn around right\" is the verb \"turn\" modified by \"around right\", but according to the rules, \"around <DIR>\" would imply that the verb is some other action. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rule. Let's read rule 3 again.\n\nRule 3 says: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the entire phrase \"around <DIR>\" modifies the verb to become a sequence of turn DIR then verb, repeated four times. So if the command is \"jump around right\", the verb is \"jump\", and each repetition is turn right then jump. So four times: turn right, jump, turn right, jump, etc., leading to four turns and four jumps.\n\nSo in the current problem, the first part of the command is \"turn around right\". The verb here is \"turn\", but \"turn\" itself can be modified by \"around right\". Wait, but according to the rules, \"around <DIR>\" would modify the verb. So if the verb is \"turn left\", then \"around right\" would replace each verb instance with \"turn right then turn left\"? That seems odd. But according to the problem's rules, maybe we have to take it as per the structure.\n\nWait, but wait. The command is \"turn around right and run right twice\". Let's split it into two parts: A and B, where A is \"turn around right\" and B is \"run right twice\". According to rule 5, \"A and B\" means do A then B.\n\nSo first process \"turn around right\". According to rule 3: \"around right\" would mean four repetitions of [turn right + verb]. The verb here is \"turn\", but wait, the original verb here would need to be a primitive verb. Wait, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb; the primitives are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" each as their own verb.\n\nWait, so \"turn around right\" might be parsed as follows: \"around right\" modifies \"turn\". Wait, but \"turn\" alone isn't a primitive. Hmm. Wait, the user input would be using the primitive verbs. Wait, the problem's first rule says primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn\" by itself is not a primitive verb. So perhaps \"turn around right\" is ambiguous. But in the input, the user wrote \"turn around right\", so we need to parse this.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct parsing is that \"around right\" is modifying the verb \"turn left\" or \"turn right\", but maybe here the user wrote \"turn around right\", which might be equivalent to \"turn right around right\"? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe \"turn around\" is a common phrase meaning turn 180 degrees, but according to the rules, \"around\" has a specific meaning. Let's try again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that \"turn around right\" is being parsed as \"turn (opposite left)\" or something else. Alternatively, perhaps \"turn around right\" is parsed as \"turn around\" (which would be a verb) but modified by \"right\". Hmm, but according to the rules, \"around\" has a specific rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is \"turn around right\" where the verb is \"turn\", and \"around right\" is a modifier. But according to the rules, modifiers like \"around\" and \"opposite\" modify a direction. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the example again.\n\nThe example input \"jump around right\" becomes four repetitions of [turn right, jump], so the verb is \"jump\", modified by \"around right\". So \"around right\" applies to the verb. So in \"turn around right\", the verb must be a primitive verb. Which primitive verb would that be? The possible verbs are \"turn left\" or \"turn right\". Wait, because the primitive verbs are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". So perhaps \"turn around right\" would be parsed as \"turn\" (but which primitive?), but perhaps the correct parsing is \"turn (around right)\" where \"around right\" is a direction modifier. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that \"turn around right\" is a command that uses the verb \"turn\", modified by \"around right\", but according to the rules, \"around <DIR>\" applies to a verb. So the verb here must be a primitive verb. However, the primitive verbs include \"turn left\" and \"turn right\", but not \"turn\" alone. Therefore, perhaps the input should be parsed as follows:\n\nWait, maybe the input is \"turn around right\" as a command, but \"turn\" is not a primitive. Therefore, perhaps the intended parsing is that \"turn\" is followed by the direction modifier \"around right\", which may not fit the rules. Alternatively, perhaps \"turn around\" is a verb, but according to the rules, the primitives are given, so this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the input. But assuming that the input is valid, perhaps the way to handle it is as follows: \"turn around right\" would be parsed as per rule 3. So \"around right\" modifies the verb. But the verb must be a primitive. The primitive verbs that are actions that can be done in a direction. Wait, but \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are their own verbs. So perhaps the verb here is \"turn left\" or \"turn right\", but the \"around right\" is modifying that. For example, \"turn left around right\" would be a stretch, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"turn around right\" is parsed as \"turn (around right)\" where \"around\" is a direction, but according to the rules, directions are left/right. Hmm.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let's try to proceed.\n\nAssuming that \"turn around right\" is supposed to be parsed using rule 3. So \"around right\" modifies the verb, which is \"turn left\" or \"turn right\". Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the problem's rule 3 says that \"around <DIR>\" equals 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So if the command is \"verb around DIR\", then the verb is the primitive verb, and each iteration is turn DIR then verb.\n\nIn the example, \"jump around right\" → four times turn right and jump. So in this problem, the structure is \"verb around DIR\".\n\nTherefore, \"turn around right\" would parse to \"around right\" modifying the verb \"turn\". But \"turn\" is not a primitive verb. The primitives are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". Therefore,", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 50, "model_reflection": "The original interpretation of 'turn around right' was incorrect. According to Rule 3, 'around <DIR>' means 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. In this case, the verb is 'turn' — but 'turn' is not a valid primitive action by itself. The phrase 'turn around right' should be interpreted as turning around using the primitive actions available. Since 'turn around' typically means turning 180 degrees, this should be interpreted as two turns in the same direction (I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT). Repeating that four times (as per Rule 3) would be [I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT] × 4 → I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT. That part was correct. However, the interpretation of 'run right' as a verb followed by a turn is incorrect. 'run right' is not a standard primitive. Instead, 'run' is the verb and 'right' modifies the direction. Since direction isn't part of the primitive verb list unless it's a turn, 'run right' should be interpreted as I_RUN only. The 'twice' modifier then applies to the entire phrase 'run right', so it should be repeated twice. Therefore, 'run right twice' should be I_RUN I_RUN. Finally, Rule 5 applies: 'A and B' = A followed by B. So 'turn around right' followed by 'run right twice' becomes: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_RUN.", "new_response": "I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_RUN"}

The user wants me to process \"look around right twice and jump opposite right\". \n\nFirst, I need to handle each part of the command according to the rules provided. Let's start with \"look around right twice\". The \"around right\" part means that we turn right and perform the action four times. But wait, the verb here is \"look\", which isn't one of the primitive verbs listed. The rules mention that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions, but \"look\" isn't in the list. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake or maybe there's an implied action. Wait, the example uses \"jump around right\" which maps to the actions I_TURN_RIGHT and I_JUMP repeatedly. So maybe \"look\" here is intended to be a primitive verb, but since it's not in the initial mapping, perhaps it's ignored or considered an error? Or maybe there's a typo and the intended verb was something else. But the user provided this input, so I have to work with it.\n\nWait, looking back at the rules, rule 1 says \"Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\" with the examples given. The list includes walk, run, jump, turn left/right. So \"look\" isn't a primitive verb here. Therefore, how to handle it? The problem is that the input might contain non-primitive verbs. But the rules don't specify handling for unknown verbs. The example in the problem uses \"jump around right\", which works because jump is a primitive. But in this case, \"look around right twice\" would require \"look\" to be a verb. Since \"look\" isn't a primitive, maybe the system should ignore it, but the user probably expects an answer. Perhaps this is a trick question, or maybe \"look\" is supposed to be treated as a primitive verb even if not listed. But according to the given rules, it's not. Alternatively, maybe the user intended \"look\" as a typo for \"walk\" or another verb. But I have to proceed with what's given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is a primitive verb here. But according to the rules, only the specified ones are. Hmm. This is a problem. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake, but maybe I should proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a primitive verb and map it to I_LOOK. But according to the rules, only the listed verbs are. Hmm. The example uses \"jump around right\" which becomes I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP etc., so the verb is \"jump\". So the structure is <verb> around <dir>, which in this case is \"look around right\". If \"look\" isn't a primitive, then perhaps the correct action is to ignore or error, but since the user provided this input, maybe we have to proceed by assuming that \"look\" is intended to be a primitive verb with action I_LOOK.\n\nSo proceeding under that assumption, \"look around right\" would be 4 repetitions of [turn right + look]. So each cycle is I_TURN_RIGHT followed by I_LOOK. So four times: I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK repeated four times. Then \"twice\" applies to the entire \"around right\" action, which complicates things.\n\nWait, the original command is \"look around right twice\". Let's parse that. According to rule 3, \"around <dir>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. The verb here is \"look\". Then \"twice\" would mean repeat the entire \"around right\" sequence twice. So first, \"look around right\" would be four instances of [turn right, look], and then \"twice\" would make that entire sequence happen twice. So total of 8 actions (each of turn right and look, four times, then again four times). Wait, no: \"around right\" is 4 repetitions of [turn dir + verb], so \"around right\" would be four times. So \"look around right\" would be four times [turn right, look]. Then \"twice\" would mean do that entire \"around right\" twice. So total of 2 * 4 * 2 actions (each turn and look, repeated four times, then again four times). Wait, no: each around right is four [turn + verb], so twice around right would be two times that. So the first part \"look around right twice\" would be:\n\nFor each of the two times:\n   I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK (four times per around right)\n\nSo overall: [I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK] *4 *2 = 8 turns right and 8 look actions? Wait, no. Wait, each \"around right\" is four repetitions of [turn right, look]. So each around right is 4*(turn right + look). Then \"twice\" would mean do that entire around right sequence two times. So each around right is four steps, twice would be eight steps. So the first part \"look around right twice\" would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK repeated four times, then again four times. So total of 8 I_TURN_RIGHT and 8 I_LOOK, in order.\n\nWait, no. Wait, each around right is four repetitions of [turn right + look]. So each around right is a sequence of turn right, look, turn right, look, turn right, look, turn right, look. So that's 4 pairs of turn and look. Then \"twice\" would mean doing that entire around right sequence twice, leading to 8 pairs. But the command is \"look around right twice\", which parses as the verb \"look around right\" modified by \"twice\". So the \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. So \"around right\" is part of the verb phrase, then \"twice\" applies to that. So yes, the entire around right sequence (which itself is four pairs) is done twice. Wait, but rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So the verb sequence here is \"look around right\". Wait, no. Let's parse \"look around right twice\".\n\nBreaking down \"look around right twice\":\n\n- \"around right\" applies to \"look\", so \"look around right\" is the verb phrase. According to rule 3, this would be four repetitions of [turn right + look]. Then \"twice\" applies to this verb phrase, so repeat \"look around right\" twice.\n\nTherefore, each \"look around right\" is four [turn right, look], so doing that twice would be:\n\n[turn right, look] four times, then again four times.\n\nSo the total for this part would be 8 turns right and 8 looks, in sequence.\n\nThen the next part is \"jump opposite right\". According to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"opposite right\" would be two turns right (since DIR is right), then the verb. The verb here is \"jump\".\n\nSo \"jump opposite right\" translates to:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nPutting it all together: first the \"look around right twice\" part, then \"jump opposite right\".\n\nBut wait, the original command is \"look around right twice and jump opposite right\". Rule 5 says \"A and B\" = do A then B in order. So the entire command is A and B, where A is \"look around right twice\" and B is \"jump opposite right\".\n\nWait, wait. Let's re-express the input: \"look around right twice and jump opposite right\". The \"and\" connects the two parts. So A is \"look around right twice\", B is \"jump opposite right\". So the order is A then B.\n\nNow, putting all the actions together:\n\nFirst part (A):\n\nFor each of the two \"around right\" sequences (since \"twice\" applies to \"look around right\"):\n\nEach \"around right\" is four times [turn right + look]. So two times that:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK repeated 4 times (first around right), then again 4 times (second time twice).\n\nWait, no. Wait, \"look around right\" is one around right (four repetitions). Then \"twice\" means do that entire around right sequence two times. So each around right is four [turn right + look], so doing that twice would be 4 * 2 = 8 [turn right + look] actions. So the first part would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK (four times for first around right), then again four times: I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK repeated four times again.\n\nWait, but the \"twice\" applies to the entire verb phrase \"look around right\", which is equivalent to one around right. Therefore, \"look around right twice\" would be doing the around right twice. So each around right is four [turn right + look], so two around rights would be two times four [turn right + look].\n\nSo the first part would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK (four times, each around right) *2.\n\nBreaking down:\n\nFirst around right (four repetitions):\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK four times:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK\n\nThen the \"twice\" would make it repeat that again:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK repeated 4 times again.\n\nSo total of 8 I_TURN_RIGHT and 8 I_LOOK.\n\nThen the second part (B): \"jump opposite right\" = two turns right then jump:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFirst the 8 actions from A, then the three from B:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK repeated 8 times? Wait, no. Wait, each around right (done twice) would be four pairs each.

First, I need to parse each part according to the rules.\n\nStarting with \"look opposite right\". The rule for \"opposite <DIR>\" says two turns in DIR direction. Since opposite right is mentioned, that would be two right turns. So \"look opposite right\" translates to two I_TURN_RIGHT actions. Wait, but the original instruction says \"look opposite right\". The verb here is \"look\", but according to the primitive verbs list, the available actions are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Hmm, \"look\" isn't listed. Wait, maybe \"look\" isn't a primitive verb here. Wait the user might have made a mistake, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" isn't one of them. But the example given in the rules uses \"jump around right\" which translates to turns and jumps. So perhaps \"look\" isn't a valid action here. Wait, but the input command is \"look opposite right and jump left\". How to handle that?\n\nWait, maybe \"look\" is part of the command but not a primitive verb. Wait, the rules state that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So if \"look\" isn't in the list, perhaps it's not a valid action. But the user provided this input, so maybe there's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is intended to be a turn action. Wait, maybe the user intended \"look\" as a turn. For example, \"turn left\" is I_TURN_LEFT. So \"look opposite right\" might be equivalent to turning opposite right. So \"look\" here is equivalent to \"turn\", because \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitives. So \"look opposite right\" would be the same as \"turn opposite right\", which would be two right turns. Then, \"jump left\" would be the verb, which is jump plus a direction. Wait, but according to the rules, the verb is the primitive action. Wait, \"jump left\" might be \"jump\" after a turn left? Or is \"jump left\" a direction? Wait, the rules mention \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" as primitives, but \"jump left\" isn't. Wait, in the example \"jump around right\" translates to four turns and jumps. So \"jump\" is the verb, and \"around right\" applies to it. So in the current input, \"jump left\" could be ambiguous. Wait, the user wrote \"jump left\" after \"look opposite right and\". Let me re-examine the rules.\n\nRule 1: Primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump left\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, \"jump\" is the verb. If someone says \"jump left\", perhaps \"left\" is a direction here, but according to the rules, the direction modifiers are \"opposite\", \"around\", etc. Hmm. Wait, perhaps \"jump left\" is a mistake, and should be \"turn left then jump\", but according to the problem's input, how to parse this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump left\" is equivalent to \"turn left then jump\". Or maybe \"jump left\" isn't a valid primitive, so the system should parse \"jump\" and \"turn left\" somehow. Wait, the original command is \"look opposite right and jump left\". Let's parse \"look opposite right\" first. If \"look\" isn't a primitive, maybe it's a typo and should be \"turn\". So \"turn opposite right\" would be two right turns. Then \"jump left\" would be \"jump\" after turning left. Wait, but according to rule 5, \"A and B\" is A then B. So \"look opposite right and jump left\" would be \"look opposite right\" (which is two right turns) followed by \"jump left\". But what's \"jump left\"? If \"jump left\" is a verb with direction, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are only the ones listed, and directions are used in the modifiers. So perhaps \"jump left\" is a misstatement and should be \"jump after turn left\"? Or maybe \"jump left\" is equivalent to \"turn left then jump\". Because \"turn left\" is a primitive verb, so \"jump left\" could be parsed as \"turn left then jump\", but that's not a rule specified. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is a typo for \"turn left and jump\". Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is a sequence where you turn left and then jump. So \"jump left\" would be I_TURN_LEFT followed by I_JUMP. But according to the rules, there's no direct mapping for that. The rules specify that \"opposite\" and \"around\" are modifiers that apply to a verb. So perhaps \"jump left\" is simply \"jump\", but the direction isn't relevant here. Wait, but \"turn left\" is a primitive verb. Maybe the user intended \"jump left\" as \"turn left then jump\". Let's proceed with that assumption. So \"jump left\" would be I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is a mistake, and the correct command is \"turn left then jump\", but given the input, we have to parse it.\n\nWait, the example input was \"jump around right\" which maps to four turns and jumps. So the \"around right\" applies to the verb \"jump\". So in \"jump left\", perhaps the \"left\" is not an action. But \"turn left\" is a primitive verb. So maybe \"jump left\" is a compound action that's equivalent to \"turn left then jump\", but that's not a standard rule. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is not a valid command, but the user input has it. Alternatively, maybe \"jump left\" is a misstatement, and the correct action is \"turn left and jump\", which would be \"turn left then jump\". But according to the input, we have \"look opposite right and jump left\".\n\nPutting this together:\n\nAssuming \"look opposite right\" is equivalent to \"turn opposite right\", which would be two right turns. Then \"jump left\" would be \"turn left then jump\", but how to parse \"jump left\" according to the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is a verb followed by a direction, but the direction isn't a modifier. So \"jump\" and \"left\" may not be directly related. Wait, but according to the rules, directions are part of the modifiers. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended \"look opposite right\" to be \"turn opposite right\", which would be two right turns. Then \"jump left\" would be \"turn left and jump\", but according to the rules, how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"and\" in \"A and B\" means A then B. So the entire command is \"look opposite right\" followed by \"jump left\", each parsed as separate.\n\nSo first parse \"look opposite right\" as:\n\nopposite right means two right turns. But what's the verb? Wait, the verb here would be \"look\", which isn't a primitive verb. This is a problem. Because according to the rules, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" is not a primitive verb. Therefore, the input \"look opposite right\" may be invalid. But the user provided it, so perhaps \"look\" is a typo for \"turn\" or another primitive. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" here is a mistake, but we need to process it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look opposite right\" is treated as \"turn opposite right\", leading to two right turns. Assuming that \"look\" is equivalent to \"turn\" here. But this isn't stated in the rules. Alternatively, the system should ignore non-primitive verbs. Maybe this is a trick question. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended \"look\" as a direction, but I'm stuck.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the problem. The user says \"look opposite right and jump left\". The first part is \"look opposite right\". The rules state that \"opposite <DIR>\" applies to a verb. Wait, the structure is \"verb opposite DIR\". But in this case, \"look\" is the verb, but it's not a primitive. So perhaps \"look opposite right\" is not a valid construct. Unless \"look\" is a verb that can be broken into some actions. But according to the given rules, the primitives are specific.\n\nSo perhaps the input is malformed. However, the user expects us to process it. Alternatively, maybe \"look opposite right\" is equivalent to \"turn opposite right\", which would be two right turns. Then \"jump left\" would be the next action. But \"jump left\" would be \"jump\" plus direction? Or \"turn left then jump\"?\n\nWait, \"jump left\" could be parsed as \"jump\" after \"turn left\", but according to rule 6: \"A after B\" is B then A. But the input here is \"jump left\", not using \"after\". Alternatively, per rule 5: \"A and B\" is A then B. So the entire command is \"look opposite right\" (A) and \"jump left\" (B). So first parse A then parse B.\n\nBut again, \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. So perhaps there's a mistake here, and \"look\" should be \"turn\", but I'll proceed under that assumption. Otherwise, the input would not be parsable.\n\nAssuming \"look opposite right\" means \"turn opposite right\", then according to rule 2: opposite right means two right turns.

The input is \"turn around right twice after turn around right twice\". Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let's break it down according to the rules provided.\n\nFirst, I need to parse each part of the command. The main structure here is \"A after B\", which according to rule 6 means doing B first and then A. So the entire command is structured as (turn around right twice) after (turn around right twice). So we have two instances of \"turn around right twice\", with the second one being executed first, followed by the first one.\n\nNow, let's parse \"turn around right twice\". Breaking this down, \"around right\" refers to rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" means 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. The verb here is \"turn\". Wait, but \"turn\" is the verb here. Wait, wait, the phrase is \"turn around right\". Wait, no: \"turn around right\" would be parsed as \"around right\" applied to \"turn\". Wait, no, the original command is \"turn around right twice\". Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grouping.\n\nWait, the phrase \"turn around right\" would be parsed using rule 3. The rule says \"around <DIR>\" means doing [turn DIR + verb] four times. So \"around right\" would apply to the verb that precedes it. Wait, wait, the structure here is \"turn around right twice\". Let me parse this part first.\n\nWait, \"turn around right\" — perhaps the \"around right\" is modifying the verb \"turn\". According to rule 3, \"around right\" would mean that the verb (turn) is combined with turning right four times. Wait, no: rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So if the command is \"verb around DIR\", then you do [turn DIR + verb] four times. So in \"turn around right\", the verb is \"turn\", and \"around right\" is the modifier. Therefore, applying rule 3, this would be four repetitions of [I_TURN_RIGHT then I_TURN]. Wait, that seems odd. Wait, the verb is \"turn\", which maps to I_TURN. So each repetition in the around would be \"turn right then turn\", so four times. So \"turn around right\" would translate to:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN\n\nWait, because each of the four repetitions is [turn DIR + verb], so each time, first turn right, then do the verb (turn). Wait, but \"turn\" as a verb here is a single action. Hmm, but \"turn around right\" would be the command \"turn around right\", so the verb here is \"turn\" and the \"around right\" is the modifier. So each of the four steps would be turn right then turn. So four times that sequence. So four times [I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN]. So that would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN repeated four times. So total eight actions.\n\nThen, after that \"around right\", there's \"twice\". So rule 4 says \"verb twice\" is repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, but in this case, the entire \"around right\" structure is the modifier for the verb. Wait, no, the original phrase is \"turn around right twice\". So the \"twice\" applies to \"turn around right\". Let's parse \"turn around right twice\". So \"twice\" applies to the entire \"turn around right\" action. So first, parse \"turn around right\" into the four repetitions, then repeat that entire sequence twice.\n\nWait, but according to rule 4: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"around\" is a modifier to the verb. Then \"twice\" would repeat the entire verb sequence. So \"turn around right twice\" would be: [turn around right] done twice. Which would be each \"around right\" being four [turn right + turn], then done twice. So each around right is 8 actions (four repetitions of two actions each), then twice that entire around right. Wait, no. Wait, the \"twice\" applies to the verb plus its modifiers. So \"turn around right\" is four repetitions of [turn right + turn], which is 4*(2 actions) =8 actions. Then \"twice\" would mean doing that entire 8 actions twice. So 16 actions total.\n\nWait, but rule 4 says that \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Then rule 3 says that. So \"turn around right\" would be four times [I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN], which is 8 actions. Then \"twice\" would be repeating that entire sequence twice, so 16 actions.\n\nBut wait, in the example given, \"jump around right\" becomes four repetitions of turn right then jump, so four times. The example output is four turns right followed by four jumps (alternated). So yes, each around step is [turn DIR + verb], four times. So for \"jump around right\", it's four times [turn right then jump], so eight actions. So yes.\n\nNow, the original input is \"turn around right twice after turn around right twice\". Let's parse each part.\n\nFirst, the right-hand side is \"turn around right twice\", which is the same as the left-hand side. According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So the entire command is:\n\n[turn around right twice] after [turn around right twice] → do B then A, where B and A are the same.\n\nSo each B and A is \"turn around right twice\", which is 16 actions each? Let me confirm.\n\nBreaking down \"turn around right twice\":\n\n- \"turn around right\" is rule 3: four repetitions of [turn right + turn], which would be four times [I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN], so 8 actions.\n- \"twice\" (rule 4) applies to the verb sequence. Wait, rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"turn around right\" is the verb with around right modifier. So \"turn around right twice\" would repeat the entire \"turn around right\" sequence twice. But \"turn around right\" itself is already four repetitions of [turn dir + verb]. Wait, perhaps the \"twice\" applies to the entire around sequence. Hmm.\n\nWait, according to rule 4: \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions. Then, \"verb twice\" is repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, but if the verb has modifiers like \"around\", then how does \"twice\" apply? For example, \"walk around left twice\" would be the \"around left\" sequence (which is four steps of [turn left + walk]), then repeat that entire around left sequence twice. So \"around left\" is four repetitions, then twice would make it eight repetitions? No, wait, no. Wait, \"walk around left twice\" would be the \"walk around left\" (four repetitions of turn left and walk) done twice. So each around left is four repetitions, then twice would make two times four repetitions. So total 8 repetitions of [turn left walk], leading to 16 actions. Wait, no. Wait, each around left is four times [turn left walk], so doing that twice would mean 4 * 2 = 8 times [turn left walk], which would be 16 actions. But how does rule 4 work in combination with around?\n\nRule 4 says that \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"walk around left twice\" would mean that the entire verb sequence modified by \"around left\" is repeated twice. So the entire around left sequence (four repetitions) is done twice. So that would be 4 * 2 = eight [turn left walk] pairs, leading to 16 actions.\n\nBut wait, the \"around\" is part of the verb sequence. So \"turn around right twice\" would mean that the verb modified by around right is repeated twice. So first, parse \"turn around right\" as per rule 3: four times [turn right turn], then \"twice\" would repeat that entire four-step sequence twice. So each four steps (eight actions: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN four times), then repeated twice. Wait, no. Wait, each \"turn around right\" is four repetitions of [turn right then turn], which is four times two actions each, so eight actions. Then \"twice\" would repeat that eight-action sequence twice. So total 16 actions.\n\nTherefore, each \"turn around right twice\" is 8 actions * 2 = 16 actions.\n\nNow, the original command is \"A after B\" where A and B are both \"turn around right twice\". Therefore, according to rule 6, we need to execute B then A, both of which are 16 actions each. So total 32 actions.\n\nNow, let's build the sequence step by step.\n\nFirst, parse B: \"turn around right twice\".\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n\"turn around right\" → four times [I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN]\n\nSo:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN repeated four times → 8 actions.\n\nThen \"twice\" → repeat the entire 8 actions again. So total 16 actions:\n\nFirst four repetitions (8 actions), then another four repetitions (8 actions), totaling 16.\n\nWait, but wait: \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. So the verb sequence here is the \"turn around right\", which is four repetitions.

The user wants me to process the instruction: \"turn opposite left twice after turn left twice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the command according to the given rules. Let's break it down. The main structure here is \"A after B\", which according to rule 6 means doing B first and then A. So, the entire command is split into two parts: A and B.\n\nPart B is \"turn left twice\". According to rule 4, \"twice\" means repeating the verb sequence twice. The verb here is \"turn left\", which maps to I_TURN_LEFT. So \"turn left twice\" would be I_TURN_LEFT repeated twice: I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT.\n\nNow part A is \"turn opposite left twice\". Let's parse this. The phrase \"opposite left\" is defined in rule 2 as two turns in the specified direction. Wait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no. Wait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no, wait. Wait the example in the rules says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no. Wait the wording is: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, perhaps the user made a typo. Wait, looking back:\n\nRule 2 says: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, that seems odd. Because to face the opposite direction, you would typically turn 180 degrees, which could be two turns left or right. So, for example, if the original direction is left, then opposite left would mean two turns left. But according to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" translates to two turns in DIR followed by the verb. Wait, but the structure here is when you have a verb preceded by \"opposite DIR\". For example, if the instruction was \"walk opposite left\", then according to rule 2, it would be two turns left (to face opposite), then walk. But in the current example, the verb here is \"turn\", so how does that work?\n\nWait, in the given problem, the instruction is \"turn opposite left twice\". Wait, but let's step back. The original command is \"turn opposite left twice after turn left twice\". So part A is \"turn opposite left twice\". Let's parse \"turn opposite left\".\n\nWait, \"turn opposite left\" would be a verb \"turn\" with \"opposite left\" as the direction. Wait, but the verb is \"turn left\" or \"turn opposite left\"? Let me re-examine the command.\n\nThe command is \"turn opposite left twice after turn left twice\". So the first part (A) is \"turn opposite left twice\", and the second part (B) is \"turn left twice\". But according to rule 6, \"A after B\" means B then A. So the entire sequence is B followed by A.\n\nBut first, let's parse each part. Let's start with B: \"turn left twice\". According to rule 4, \"twice\" means repeat the verb twice. The verb here is \"turn left\", which is I_TURN_LEFT. So \"turn left twice\" would be I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT.\n\nNow part A: \"turn opposite left twice\". Let's break this down. The main verb here is \"turn\", but the direction is \"opposite left\". Wait, but according to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, but how does that apply here? Wait, perhaps the structure is that if you have a verb (like turn left, run, etc.) preceded by \"opposite\", then \"opposite <DIR>\" would modify the direction. Wait, maybe the \"opposite left\" here is part of the verb phrase. So \"turn opposite left\" would mean applying the rule 2 to \"opposite left\" in the context of a turn.\n\nWait, rule 2 says that \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, but the example given in the rules is \"jump around right\" which becomes four repetitions of turn right then jump, leading to the output in the example.\n\nWait, perhaps rule 2 should be interpreted as: if the command is \"opposite <DIR> then a verb\", then you do two turns in DIR, then perform the verb. Wait, but how does that fit into the current command?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"opposite <DIR>\" is a direction modifier. So \"turn opposite left\" would mean to turn in the direction opposite to left, which is right. But according to rule 2, it's two turns in DIR (left) and then the verb. So \"turn opposite left\" would be two left turns (which would face the opposite direction, then perform the verb. Wait, but the verb here is \"turn\", so this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, let's think again. Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So if the original command was \"walk opposite left\", that would translate to two left turns (I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT), then I_WALK.\n\nBut in our current case, the verb is \"turn\". Wait, but \"turn opposite left\" would be parsed as \"turn\" modified by \"opposite left\". So according to rule 2, \"opposite left\" would mean two left turns, then the verb. Wait, but the verb here is turn. Hmm, this seems conflicting. Because \"turn opposite left\" would then be two left turns, then a turn. But that doesn't make sense. Maybe the verb here is the main verb of the entire command.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is that \"opposite <DIR>\" modifies the direction of the verb. So for example, \"turn opposite left\" would be equivalent to \"turn in the direction opposite to left\", i.e., right. But according to rule 2, it's two left turns, then the verb. Wait, but that would be for a command like \"walk opposite left\" which would be two left turns then walk. So in that case, you turn left twice (which faces you opposite), then walk. So the same logic applies. So in the current case, the command is \"turn opposite left\". Applying rule 2, this would be two left turns (I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT), then the verb, which here is \"turn\". Wait, but the verb here is \"turn\", but how does that fit? Because the verb's direction is modified by \"opposite left\".\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Let's re-express. The entire command is \"turn opposite left twice\". Let's parse this phrase. The main verb is \"turn\", modified by \"opposite left\", and then repeated \"twice\".\n\nBut according to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"turn opposite left\" would be parsed as two left turns, then the verb \"turn\". Wait, but that would mean that \"turn opposite left\" becomes I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_???. Wait, no. Because the original verb is \"turn opposite left\", which according to rule 2 would be transformed into two left turns followed by the verb. The verb in this case is \"turn\". But what direction is the turn?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding rule 2. Let's read again: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So when you have a command that has a verb preceded by \"opposite <DIR>\", you first perform two turns in <DIR> direction, then perform the verb. So for example, if the command is \"walk opposite left\", then you first turn left twice (to face the opposite direction), then walk. So the action sequence would be I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK.\n\nBut in our current case, the command is \"turn opposite left twice\". Wait, the main verb here is \"turn opposite left\", and then \"twice\". Wait, perhaps \"turn opposite left\" is the verb phrase. So applying rule 2, \"opposite left\" would mean that the verb \"turn\" (but in what direction?) is preceded by two left turns. Or perhaps the verb here is \"turn\", and \"opposite left\" is the direction. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the phrase is \"turn opposite left\", which would require two turns in left direction, then a turn. But that would be conflicting. Let's think again.\n\nThe command \"turn opposite left\" would, according to rule 2, expand to two left turns (I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT), then the verb. But the verb here is \"turn\". Wait, but then the verb (turn) needs a direction. This seems like a problem. So perhaps rule 2 applies to verbs that have a direction component. For example, \"turn left\" is a verb with direction. But \"opposite left\" is modifying the direction. So \"turn opposite left\" would mean to turn in the opposite left direction, which would be equivalent to turning right. But according to rule 2, it would be two left turns, then the verb. Wait, but then the verb is \"turn\", which direction?\n\nThis seems conflicting. Maybe the problem is that the verb here is \"turn\", and \"opposite left\" is the direction. So \"turn opposite left\" would be equivalent to \"turn in the direction opposite to left\", which is right. So the action would be I_TURN_RIGHT. However, according to rule 2, \"opposite left\" would mean two left turns,", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 90, "model_reflection": "The interpretation of 'opposite left' as a turn to the right is consistent with the logic that opposite left implies the opposite direction of left, which is right.

The command uses \"and\", which means we do the first part then the second part in order. So I'll split this into two parts: \"jump around left\" and \"run right twice\".\n\nStarting with \"jump around left\". Rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb is jump and DIR is left. So each cycle is turn left then jump. Since it's 4 times, that would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP repeated four times. Let me write that out: I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP.\n\nNow the second part: \"run right twice\". The phrase \"run right\" would be I_RUN followed by turning right, but wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, \"run right\" probably means run in the right direction. Wait, but according to the rules, \"run\" maps to I_RUN. But how does direction apply here? Wait, the primitive verbs map directly. So \"run right\" might be I_RUN followed by a turn right. Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, in the example given, \"jump around right\" resulted in four turns right and jumps. So when they say \"run right\", does that mean the direction you run is to the right, which would imply a turn right first then run? Or is \"run right\" a single verb? But according to the rules, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"run\" is I_RUN, and \"turn right\" is I_TURN_RIGHT. Therefore, \"run right\" must be interpreted as running in the right direction, which would require turning right first then running. Wait, but maybe the direction here is part of the run command? Wait, no. The problem says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\". So the verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"run\" is I_RUN, and \"turn right\" is a separate action. So if the command is \"run right\", that would mean \"turn right then run\"? Or is \"run right\" considered a single verb? Hmm, this is ambiguous. Wait, looking at the example. The example input is \"jump around right\" which translates to four turns right and jumps. So around right breaks into four times [turn right and jump]. So in that case, the verb is jump, and direction is right. But how does direction affect the verb? The rule says \"around <DIR>\" means 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So for each step in around, you turn in DIR direction and then perform the verb. So in this case, each time you turn right then jump.\n\nWait, so \"run right\" here would be a separate command. Wait, but \"run right\" would be \"turn right then run\"? But according to the rules, \"run\" is I_RUN, and \"turn right\" is I_TURN_RIGHT. So the command \"run right\" is not a primitive verb, so we have to parse it as \"run\" and \"right\" as a direction. Hmm, perhaps. Wait, the problem's rule 1 says primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"run\" is a verb, but \"run right\" isn't listed. Wait, no. Wait, the primitive verbs are listed. So \"run\" is a primitive verb, and \"turn right\" is another. So \"run right\" would have to be parsed as two separate verbs? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake. Wait, the input command is \"run right twice\". So according to the rules, \"run\" maps to I_RUN, and \"turn right\" maps to I_TURN_RIGHT. So perhaps \"run right\" is intended to be \"run in the right direction\", which would require turning right first then running. But according to the rules, how is direction handled? Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe \"run right\" is a misinterpretation. Wait, the input command is \"run right twice\". Let's parse that. The phrase could be parsed as \"run right\" with a modifier \"twice\". But according to the rules, \"run\" and \"turn right\" are separate actions. So perhaps \"run right\" is being used as a compound verb, which might not be a primitive. But according to the rules, only the primitives are mapped. Therefore, perhaps \"run right\" is being used as \"run\" and then \"turn right\", but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe \"run right\" is equivalent to \"turn right then run\", but how? Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says \"parse the command\" using the rules. Let's look at the current input. The second part is \"run right twice\". Rule 4 says \"twice\" means repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"run right\" is the verb sequence, and it's done twice. Wait, but \"run\" and \"right\" are separate words. So \"run right\" is a verb followed by a direction. Wait, perhaps \"run\" after turning to the right direction. So \"run right\" would be equivalent to \"turn right and run\", according to rule 5. But how is that? Hmm. Let's think.\n\nIn the example, \"jump around right\" is parsed into four turns right and jumps. So \"around right\" is a modifier on the verb jump.\n\nBut here, \"run right\" could be a command. But according to the rules, \"run\" is a primitive verb. So the word \"right\" here in \"run right\" may be indicating direction, but according to the rules, how?\n\nWait, maybe \"run right\" is equivalent to \"turn right then run\", but how? Because in the primitive verbs, run is a separate action. So perhaps the correct approach is to take \"run right\" as \"run in the direction of right\", which would require turning right and then running. Or maybe \"run right\" is a direction modifier. But according to the rules, directions are used in \"opposite <DIR>\", \"around <DIR>\", and \"turn left/right\". So perhaps \"run right\" isn't a valid primitive. Therefore, the user might have made a mistake, but the input is given, so we have to parse it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run right\" is a mistake and should be \"turn right and run\". But given the input, we need to parse \"run right twice\" as per the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps \"run right\" is a misstatement and should be \"run around right\", but no, the input is as given.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to parse \"run right\" as \"run\" in the right direction, which would require turning right and then running. But how often? Or perhaps \"run right\" is a direction, but according to the rules, this isn't covered. Hmm. Let me think again.\n\nRule 1 says that primitive verbs (like run) map to uppercase actions. So \"run\" is I_RUN. \"turn right\" is I_TURN_RIGHT. So \"run right\" must be two separate verbs. But that's conflicting. Unless \"run right\" is a compound command. Alternatively, perhaps the input is \"run around right twice\", but no, the input is \"run right twice\".\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended \"run right\" as \"run in the right direction\", which would imply that you have to turn right first, then run. But how does that fit with the rules? Let's think. If the command is \"run right\", perhaps it's equivalent to \"turn right then run\", but how would that be expressed? Because \"run right\" isn't a primitive. So maybe \"run right\" is equivalent to \"turn right and run\", which by rule 5 would be run after turning. But then the problem is that the input is \"run right twice\". Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run right\" is a mistake, and the correct command is \"turn right run twice\", but given the input, we have to work with it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run right\" is parsed as \"run\" and then \"turn right\", but that would be \"run then turn right\", which might not make sense. But according to the rules, how would direction affect the verb? The only way direction affects verbs is in the \"around\" and \"opposite\" constructs.\n\nHmm. Maybe \"run right\" here is a mistake, but the intended parsing is \"run\" and \"right\" as separate parts. But I'm stuck here.\n\nWait, looking at the original problem. The example input is \"jump around right\" which translates to four turns right and jumps. So around is a direction modifier. So perhaps in the current problem, \"jump around left\" would be handled as four turns left and jumps, then the other part.\n\nNow the second part is \"run right twice\". Since \"run\" is a primitive verb, and \"right\" is a direction. The phrase \"run right\" might be a way to say \"run while facing right\", but to do that, you need to turn right and then run. But how?\n\nWait, but according to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" means two turns in DIR then the verb. So direction modifiers can affect the verb.\n\nBut \"run right\" isn't a construct covered by the rules. So perhaps the user made a mistake here, but we need to parse it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run right\" is equivalent to \"turn right then run\". So \"run right\" would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN.\n\nThen \"run right twice\"", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The initial response correctly applies the grammar and transformation rules provided.

Since \"jump left\" is invalid, the parsing cannot proceed as per the rules. But assuming the intent is to treat \"jump left\" as a non-primitive verb (e.g., \"jump\" with direction), the output would follow the structure of repeating B thrice, then A thrice. Thus:\n\n**OUT:** I_JUMP_LEFT I_JUMP_LEFT I_JUMP_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT", "model_reasoning": "Okay, let's break down the command step by step. The input is \"turn left thrice after jump left thrice\". \n\nFirst, according to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So here, A is \"turn left thrice\" and B is \"jump left thrice\". So the order should be B first, then A.\n\nLet's parse B: \"jump left thrice\". The verb here is \"jump left\", which is a primitive verb. So \"jump left\" thrice would be repeating that action three times. So that would be I_JUMP_LEFT three times.\n\nThen A is \"turn left thrice\". Similarly, \"turn left\" is a primitive verb, so repeat it three times. That's I_TURN_LEFT three times.\n\nPutting them in order, B then A: three I_JUMP_LEFT followed by three I_TURN_LEFT.\n\nWait, but wait, the original command says \"turn left thrice after jump left thrice\". So according to rule 6, \"A after B\" is B then A. So the \"jump left thrice\" (B) comes first, then \"turn left thrice\" (A). So the sequence should be [jump left, jump left, jump left, turn left, turn left, turn left].\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to check if \"jump left\" and \"turn left\" are considered primitive verbs. According to rule 1, \"turn left\" maps to I_TURN_LEFT, which is a primitive. \"jump\" is I_JUMP, but \"jump left\" isn't listed. Wait, the problem here is whether \"jump left\" is a valid primitive. The rules list the primitives as walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump left\" isn't a primitive verb. Oh, wait! Wait, the original problem says \"primitive verbs\" map to certain actions. So the verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump left\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, the user's example input was \"jump around right\" which uses \"jump\" as the verb. So in the current problem, \"jump left\" is not a primitive verb. Wait, the user's command is \"jump left thrice\" — but \"jump left\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, this is a problem. Because according to rule 1, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump left\" isn't a primitive verb. Hmm, so how to parse this?\n\nWait, the user's input might have a mistake here. Let me check again. The input is \"turn left thrice after jump left thrice\". So the two actions here are \"turn left\" and \"jump left\". But \"jump left\" isn't a primitive verb. Because according to rule 1, the primitive verbs are jump, turn left, etc. So \"jump\" is a verb, and \"turn left\" is a verb. But \"jump left\" is not listed. So perhaps \"jump left\" is being used as a verb here, but according to the rules, it's not a primitive. Therefore, this suggests that maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps we need to interpret \"jump left\" as a composite verb. Wait, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are specifically listed. Therefore, \"jump left\" isn't a primitive. Therefore, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, maybe \"jump left\" is intended as \"jump\" plus a direction. But according to the given rules, only the following are primitives: walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump left\" is not a primitive verb. So perhaps this is a problem in the input. However, since the input is given as such, we have to work with it. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is a mistake, but the user intended \"jump\" in the example. Wait, but the example uses \"jump around right\", which uses \"jump\" as the verb. Hmm. So perhaps the user's input has a \"jump left\" which isn't a valid primitive. How to handle this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump left\" is a compound verb that's not a primitive, but according to the rules, only the primitives are mapped. Wait, the problem states that the agent is a semantic parsing agent for navigation commands, and the rules are for mapping. So if \"jump left\" isn't a primitive, then perhaps it's not a valid command. However, given that the user provided this input, perhaps we need to assume that \"jump left\" is a valid verb. Wait, the example uses \"jump around right\", which uses \"jump\" as the verb. Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So the verb here would be a primitive verb. Similarly, \"around <DIR>\" applies to a verb.\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump left\" is a verb followed by a direction, but according to rule 1, only turn left and turn right are primitives. So perhaps \"jump left\" is not a valid command. However, the user provided this input, so maybe there's an error here, but we have to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is a compound verb. But according to the rules, the primitive verbs are as listed, so other combinations are not defined. This is a problem. However, given the example, perhaps the user intended \"jump left\" to be a verb. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is \"jump\" as the verb and \"left\" as a direction. Wait, but the rules don't specify that. Rule 2 and 3 involve directions, but the verbs themselves are directionless. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump left\" here is being used as a verb, but according to the rules, that's not a primitive. Therefore, this is a problem. But since the user provided this input, we have to find a way to parse it. Maybe \"jump left\" is a mistake, but the intended verb is \"jump\" and the direction is left, but how? Alternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is equivalent to \"turn left then jump\", but that's not stated in the rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump left\" is a typo for \"turn left\", but the user input is as given. Since the problem states that the agent should process the command, perhaps the agent must parse it according to the given rules. So \"jump left\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, maybe the correct approach here is to treat \"jump left\" as invalid. But that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is a combination of \"turn left\" and \"jump\". Wait, but there's no rule for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"left\" in \"jump left\" is a direction, but the verb is \"jump\", and the direction is being ignored. But that's not specified in the rules.\n\nHmm. This is a problem. The input seems to have a non-primitive verb. But according to the rules, we can't process it. But since the user provided this input, perhaps the intended interpretation is that \"jump left\" is a verb with direction left, but according to the rules, the verb's direction is part of the primitive. Wait, the primitives are \"turn left\", \"turn right\", which include direction, but other verbs like \"walk\", \"run\", \"jump\" don't have direction. So \"walk left\" would be a non-primitive. So how to parse \"jump left\"?\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump left\" is equivalent to \"jump\" followed by \"turn left\"? Or \"turn left then jump\"? Not according to the given rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, but assuming that the input is correct, perhaps the user intended \"jump\" and \"turn left\" as separate verbs here. But then the command would be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"jump left\" is a typo for \"turn left\", but then the answer would be different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump left\" is a misstatement for \"jump around left\", but that's not the case here.\n\nThis is a critical issue. If the input includes verbs that are not primitives, how to handle? The problem states that the agent is a semantic parsing agent, so perhaps the agent should ignore non-primitive verbs and only parse the primitives. But that's not addressed in the rules.\n\nWait, looking back at the example: \"jump around right\" uses the verb \"jump\", which is a primitive. So \"jump left\" would be a verb plus direction, but not a primitive. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to treat \"jump left\" as a verb with direction, but according to the rules, the only verbs that take directions are turn left/right. All other verbs (walk, run, jump) don't have directions. Therefore, \"jump left\" is not a valid primitive verb, and the agent can't parse it. But since the input is given, perhaps the user intended to use \"turn left\" thrice after \"jump\" thrice. But then the input would be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is a mistake, and it should be \"jump thrice and turn left thrice\", but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to use \"jump\" and \"turn left\", but the input is structured as \"jump left thrice\". So maybe \"jump left\" is a command that combines jump and a direction, which isn't covered by the current rules. However, given that the rules are fixed, the agent must parse according to them. Therefore, \"jump left\" is not a primitive verb, so the agent can't process it. However, this seems unlikely, so perhaps the correct approach here is to assume that \"jump left\" is a mistake and", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 40, "model_reflection": "The initial response assumed that 'jump left' could be treated as a non-primitive verb, but according to the given rules, only specific primitive verbs (walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right) are allowed, and 'jump left' is not among them.

Wait, the correct order would be the B part (run opposite left thrice) followed by the A part (run around right twice). Let's re-express:\n\nFirst, run opposite left thrice:\n\nEach \"run opposite left\" is I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN. \"thrice\" means three times this:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\n\nThen run around right twice:\n\nEach \"run around right\" is four repetitions of [turn right + run], which is I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN four times. \"twice\" means repeat this entire around right sequence twice, so:\n\n(I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN) repeated twice, resulting in:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN\n\nCombine both parts:\n\nB followed by A:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN\n\nWait, but each around right is four times [turn + run], so first around right has four of those, then the second around right another four. So total eight turns right and eight runs? But the answer above shows 8 I_TURN_RIGHT and 8 I_RUN? But in the answer I wrote, it's 8 I_TURN and 8 I_RUN? Hmm.\n\nWait, the output for \"run around right\" is four times [turn right run], which is 4 turns and 4 runs. So four pairs. Then \"twice\" would mean doing that again. So total of 8 pairs. So:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN (four pairs, first around right) followed by same again for the second around right. So total eight pairs (16 actions?), no. Wait, each around right is four pairs (eight actions), then twice would be 16 actions. But in the previous output I wrote, there are 9 I_TURN_RIGHTs. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nrun around right → 4 repetitions of [turn right, run], so:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN (four turns right and four runs)\n\nThen \"twice\" means repeat that entire sequence (which is eight actions) again, so another four turns and runs. So total eight turns and eight runs. So:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN\n\nSo eight pairs. That's 16 actions total for the A part.\n\nSo combining with B:\n\nB part: three repetitions of \"run opposite left\", each being two left turns and a run:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN repeated three times:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\n\nSo nine actions here (each repetition is three actions: two turns, one run. 3 * 3 =9).\n\nThen the A part (16 actions):\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN repeated eight times → but written as alternating.\n\nSo the final output is:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN\n\nBut wait, how many times?\n\nAfter B:\n\nEach of the three \"run opposite left\" → each \"run\" is preceded by two left turns. So each three actions, three times → 9 actions.\n\nThen the A part: run around right twice.\n\nrun around right once: four [turn, run], so eight actions.\n\ntwice: 16 actions.\n\nSo total:\n\n9 actions (B) followed by 16 (A) = 25 actions.\n\nBut in the output I wrote above, the A part has 8 I_TURN_RIGHT and 8 I_RUN, but written as:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN eight times.

So eight pairs. So yes, eight I_TURN_RIGHT and eight I_RUN.\n\nBut when written out, that's eight pairs, each turn and run. So 16 elements.\n\nSo the final output should be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN repeated thrice, then I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN repeated 8 times.\n\nWait, but eight times would be four around right sequences done twice. Because each around is four → twice → eight.\n\nBut according to the rules, \"run around right\" → four repetitions. Then \"twice\" → repeat that verb (run around right) twice, so total of eight repetitions of [turn right, run].\n\nYes. So the output sequence:\n\nFor B:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN repeated thrice:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\n\nFor A:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN repeated 8 times:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN\n\nSo the complete answer combines both:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN", "model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this command step by step. The user wants me to parse \"run around right twice after run opposite left thrice\". Hmm, first, I need to break down each part according to the rules provided.\n\nStarting with the right side of \"after\": \"run opposite left thrice\". The \"opposite left\" means two turns to the left, then the verb. So \"run opposite left\" becomes I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, then I_RUN. Then \"thrice\" means repeat that entire sequence three times. So each time, it's two left turns and a run, repeated thrice. So that part would be (I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN) thrice, which would be three times the same sequence.\n\nThen the left side of \"after\" is \"run around right twice\". The \"around right\" means 4 repetitions of [turn right + verb]. The verb here is run, so each around right would be turn right, run, repeated four times. Then \"twice\" means repeat that entire around right sequence twice. Wait, wait. Wait: \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"run around right\" would be: turn right, run; four times. So each of the four steps is turn right then run. Then \"twice\" means that the entire around right sequence is done twice. So that would be (I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN repeated four times) multiplied by two times? Wait, no. Wait, the \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. Wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"run around right\" is [turn right + run] four times. Then \"twice\" would mean repeat that entire sequence twice. So each around right is four steps, then doing that twice would make eight steps? Wait, wait. Wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb], so \"run around right\" becomes I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN repeated four times. Then \"twice\" would mean do that entire around right sequence twice. Wait, but \"run around right twice\" would be the \"around right\" action twice? Or does \"twice\" modify the entire \"run around right\"? According to rule 4 and rule 1: the \"run around right\" is the verb phrase. Then \"twice\" applies to that entire action. Wait, the rule says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if \"run around right\" is a verb phrase, then \"twice\" would repeat that entire verb sequence twice. But wait, \"run around right\" itself is a verb phrase that already has four repetitions. So \"run around right twice\" would be doing the entire around right sequence two times? Wait, but according to rule 4, \"around right\" is four repetitions. So maybe \"run around right\" becomes four repetitions of [turn right, run]. Then \"twice\" would mean doing that same sequence two times. Wait, but if you do around right once, it's four steps. If you do it twice, you'd do four steps twice, so eight steps total. So the \"run around right twice\" would be (I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN) four times, then again (I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN) four times again? But wait, the problem is that \"twice\" applies to the verb. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the original rule says \"A and B\" = A followed by B. \"A after B\" = B then A. Then rule 4 says that \"around <DIR>\" equals four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"run around right\" is the verb \"run\" combined with \"around right\", which becomes four times [turn right + run]. Then \"twice\" would mean that the entire \"run around right\" action is repeated twice. So each time, you do four [turn right, run], then do another four again. So total of eight actions? Wait, each around right is four times [turn, run], so each around right has four steps. So twice would mean two times around right, so eight steps total. So \"run around right twice\" would be (I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN) four times, then again (I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN) four times.\n\nSo putting that together, the left part \"run around right twice\" becomes eight actions. Then the right part \"run opposite left thrice\" is \"opposite left\" which is two turns left then run. And then \"thrice\" means repeat that three times. So each time, two left turns, then run, repeated thrice. So each repetition is three times the [I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN]. So three times that sequence.\n\nNow, the entire command is \"run around right twice after run opposite left thrice\", which means according to rule 6: \"A after B\" = B then A. So first do B (\"run opposite left thrice\"), then do A (\"run around right twice\"). Therefore, the total sequence would be the B part followed by the A part.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nB part (\"run opposite left thrice\"):\n\nEach \"run opposite left\" is two left turns and a run. So each time, I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN. Then thrice means repeat that three times. So:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN (three times)\n\nSo:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\n\nThen A part (\"run around right twice\"):\n\nEach \"run around right\" is four times [turn right, run]. Then twice means repeat that entire around right sequence twice. Wait, no. Wait, the \"twice\" applies to the verb \"run around right\". Wait, \"run around right twice\" is the verb \"run\" with \"around right\" and then \"twice\". Hmm, maybe not. Let's parse \"run around right twice\" as per the rules.\n\n\"around right\" applies to \"run\", making four repetitions of [turn right + run]. Then \"twice\" means repeat that entire verb sequence twice. So the entire around right sequence is done twice. So each around right is four [turn right run], then twice would mean eight steps.\n\nThus, \"run around right twice\" becomes:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN (four times) and then again four times again, total eight steps.\n\nWait, but the rule says \"twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if the verb sequence is \"run around right\", which itself is four [turns and run], then \"twice\" would mean do that entire verb sequence twice. So yes, eight steps.\n\nSo combining both parts:\n\nFirst the B part:\n\n3 repetitions of [I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN]\n\nWhich is:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\n\nThen the A part:\n\n2 repetitions of [I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN four times], which is eight steps:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, \"run around right\" is four repetitions of [turn right + run], which would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN repeated four times. So four times two steps each, total eight steps.\n\nThen \"twice\" would mean doing that entire around right sequence twice. So another eight steps, total 16 steps.\n\nWait, but the wording is \"run around right twice\". So \"run around right\" (the around applies to run) and then \"twice\". So according to rule 4, \"around right\" is four repetitions. Then \"twice\" would mean repeat the entire \"run around right\" action twice. Wait, but \"run around right\" is a single verb action. Or wait, according to rule 4, \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"run around right\" would be the equivalent of four times [turn right + run]. So the entire \"run around right\" becomes four repetitions of those two actions. Then \"twice\" would mean repeat that entire sequence twice. So \"run around right\" is eight steps (four times two actions each), and doing that twice would be repeating those eight steps again, leading to 16 steps total?\n\nBut according to rule 4, \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions. Then \"run around right twice\" would be \"run around right\" followed by \"run around right\" again. Because \"twice\" applies to the verb. Wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" equals four repetitions. Then \"run around right\" is four repetitions. Then \"twice\" would mean repeat the entire \"run around right\" sequence twice. So yes, doing four repetitions twice, each time four [turn and run].\n\nWait, but according to rule 1, the primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So \"around\" is a modifier on the verb. So the entire \"run around right\" is equivalent to four repetitions of [turn right and run]. Then \"twice\" would mean doing that entire sequence again. So \"run around right twice\" would be two times four repetitions each. So total of eight repetitions of [turn right, run], which would be 8 actions of I_TURN_RIGHT and I_RUN alternating.\n\nWait, no. Each around right is four times [turn right then run], so each around right has four turns right followed by four runs.

The input is \"run after run left thrice\". \n\nFirst, according to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So here, the structure is \"run after run left thrice\". Wait, the \"run\" is A and \"run left thrice\" is B? Or is \"run left thrice\" the B part?\n\nWait, the command is structured as \"run after run left thrice\". The \"run after\" part implies that the main action is \"run left thrice\", and then after that, we do \"run\". Wait, no. Rule 6 says \"A after B\" means do B then A. So the entire command before \"after\" is A, and after is B. Wait, the input is \"run after run left thrice\". So A is \"run\" and B is \"run left thrice\". Therefore, the order should be B followed by A. So first do \"run left thrice\", then do \"run\".\n\nNow, let's parse \"run left thrice\". According to rule 4, \"thrice\" means repeat the verb sequence three times. So \"run left\" is the verb sequence? Wait, \"run left\" could be parsed as run then left, but wait, \"left\" is a direction. Wait, \"run left\" might be interpreted as turning left and then running? Or is \"run left\" a possible combination? Wait, the primitive verbs are mapped to actions like I_RUN, I_TURN_LEFT, etc. So \"run left\" would be a combination of run and turn left? Hmm, but according to the rules, maybe \"run left\" is parsed as running and then turning left? Or is \"left\" part of the run command? No, probably each verb is separate. Wait, the original example: \"jump around right\" becomes four repetitions of turn right and jump, so the \"around right\" is a modifier for the jump. But in this case, \"run left thrice\" needs to be parsed. Wait, perhaps \"run left\" is two separate actions: run, then turn left. But then \"thrice\" would repeat the entire sequence. Wait, but \"run left\" could be a single action if \"left\" was part of the verb, but according to rule 1, the primitive verbs are specific. So \"run\" is I_RUN, \"turn left\" is I_TURN_LEFT. So \"run left\" would be \"run\" followed by \"turn left\"? Wait, but the original problem statement might have some structure. Let's re-examine the input.\n\nThe input is \"run after run left thrice\". Let's parse the \"run left thrice\" part first. The phrase \"run left\" could be \"run\" and then \"left\" (as a direction). But \"left\" as a verb is \"turn left\". So \"run left\" would be \"I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT\"? Then \"thrice\" applies to that sequence. So \"run left\" thrice would be repeating \"run, turn left\" three times. But wait, the \"left\" here might be part of a direction for a turn. So \"run left\" would be parsed as run and then turn left? Hmm, but the wording is ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a mistake and the intended command is \"run left\" as in moving to the left direction, but according to the primitive verbs, run is I_RUN. Maybe the \"left\" has to be a turn. So perhaps \"run left\" isn't a primitive verb, so the correct parsing would be \"run\" followed by \"turn left\". Therefore, the sequence \"run left\" would be I_RUN followed by I_TURN_LEFT, then \"thrice\" would repeat that sequence three times. So \"run left thrice\" becomes [I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT] repeated three times.\n\nThen, according to rule 6, \"run after run left thrice\" becomes first executing \"run left thrice\" (which is run, turn left, run, turn left, run, turn left), then executing \"run\". So the entire sequence would be:\n\nI_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\n\nWait, let's check again:\n\nOriginal input: run after run left thrice\n\nBreaking down:\n\n\"A after B\" → B then A. So B is \"run left thrice\", A is \"run\".\n\nProcessing B: run left thrice. Each \"run left\" is run followed by turn left. Thrice means repeat three times. So run left three times → [run, turn left] three times: run, left, run, left, run, left.\n\nThen A is run: run.\n\nSo combining B then A: run left left run left run run?\n\nWait, no, each \"run left\" is run then turn left. So three times would be:\n\nrun, turn left, run, turn left, run, turn left.\n\nThen after that, run. So the full sequence would be:\n\nI_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\n\nWait, but the \"run after run left thrice\" would be (run left thrice) followed by run, so the final action is run. So the output sequence would be the actions from B followed by the actions from A.\n\nYes. So the answer should be:\n\nI_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let's parse \"run left thrice\" again. If \"run left\" is the verb, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are the ones listed. Since \"run\" is a primitive verb, and \"turn left\" is another, but \"left\" is a direction. So \"run left\" would not be a primitive verb. Therefore, the correct parsing is \"run\" followed by \"turn left\". Then \"thrice\" applies to the sequence. So run left thrice would be [run, turn left] repeated three times.\n\nSo the first part of the command, B, is [run, turn left] three times.\n\nThen A is \"run\", so after B, run is executed.\n\nSo the entire sequence is:\n\nrun, turn left, run, turn left, run, turn left, run\n\nWhich translates to:\n\nI_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\n\nWait, but the example given in the problem statement was \"jump around right\" which becomes four turns right and four jumps. Because \"around right\" is four times [turn right + jump]. So the example output starts with I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times. Which is correct. So in that case, the verb is \"jump\", and around right is 4 repetitions of turn right plus jump. So each iteration is turn right then jump.\n\nSimilarly, in the current problem, the \"run left\" thrice would be \"run left\" as a sequence (run followed by turn left) repeated thrice. But wait, \"run left\" isn't a primitive verb. So perhaps \"run left\" is \"run\" and then \"turn left\", as separate actions. So \"run left\" as a command is not a primitive, so the thrice would apply to the sequence of both actions. So yes, \"run left thrice\" would be run, turn left three times. So each repetition is run then turn left, repeated thrice.\n\nTherefore, the total sequence is:\n\nrun, turn left, run, turn left, run, turn left, run.\n\nYes. Then the output should have each of these steps separated by spaces.\n\nSo the output is:\n\nI_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN\n\nBut wait, let's check the order. The command \"run after run left thrice\" → execute run left thrice (each run left, three times), then execute run.\n\nYes. So each run left is run followed by turn left. So three times would be:\n\nrun, turn left, run, turn left, run, turn left. Then run.\n\nSo the entire sequence is six actions from B and then one from A: total of seven actions.\n\nTherefore, the correct output should be as above.", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The input command is 'run after run left thrice'.

So here, \"run left thrice\" is A, and \"jump twice\" is B. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original command is \"run left thrice after jump twice\". The way it's structured, \"run left thrice\" is the A part, and \"jump twice\" is the B part.

So the order is: jump twice, then run left thrice.\n\nNow, breaking down each part. \n\nFirst part: \"jump twice\". According to rule 4, \"twice\" means repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"jump\" twice would be two jumps. So that's I_JUMP I_JUMP.\n\nSecond part: \"run left thrice\". Let's parse \"run left\" first. But what does \"run left\" mean? Is \"left\" a direction or a turn?

Wait, but the input is \"run left\", which might not fit the primitive verbs. Hmm, wait, the user's example uses \"run around right\", which in the example is parsed as four repetitions of turn right and run. Wait, the example input was \"jump around right\", which was parsed into four turns right and jumps. So \"around right\" is a direction. \n\nWait, but in the input for this problem, the command is \"run left thrice\". Wait, \"run left\" isn't a primitive. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake here? Or perhaps \"run left\" is equivalent to \"turn left then run\"? Wait, the rules don't mention that. Let me check the rules again.\n\nRule 1: Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. The primitives are: walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"run\" is a primitive verb, but \"run left\" is not. So perhaps \"run left\" here is a mistake, or maybe the user intended \"run\" followed by \"turn left\"? Or maybe \"left\" here is a direction, but according to the rules, how to parse it?\n\nWait, perhaps \"run left\" is a typo. Wait, but the user provided the input, so we need to parse it. Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is being used as a verb phrase where \"left\" is a direction, but according to the rules given, the primitive verbs are \"turn left\" and \"run\" separately. Therefore, \"run left\" might be interpreted as \"run\" followed by \"turn left\", but that's not specified in the rules. Hmm, this is a problem. Alternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a typo and should be \"turn left\", but assuming that the input is correct, how should we proceed?\n\nWait, looking back at the example. The example input is \"jump around right\", which uses \"around right\", which per rule 3 becomes 4 repetitions of turn right and jump. So \"around right\" is a direction. So \"right\" there is a direction. So in the current problem, the input is \"run left thrice after jump twice\". Let's look at \"run left\". If \"left\" is a direction, perhaps in the context of \"run\" it's not a standard command. But according to the rules, the primitive verbs are \"turn left\" and \"run\". So \"run left\" is not a primitive. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the user intended \"run\" followed by \"turn left\", but that's not specified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is parsed as \"run\" with direction left, but according to the rules, direction modifiers are handled via \"around <DIR>\" or \"opposite <DIR>\". So perhaps \"run left\" is not a valid command under the given rules, but since the user provided it, maybe we need to assume that \"run left\" is intended to be \"run\" followed by \"turn left\", but that's not a rule. Alternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a mistake, and the intended command was \"turn left\", but given that the problem states to process the command as given, perhaps we need to handle it.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended \"run\" and \"left\" as two separate verbs. Wait, no, because \"run left thrice\" would be \"run left\" thrice. But according to the rules, \"run\" and \"left\" (assuming \"left\" here is a direction for a turn) would be separate actions. Wait, but \"left\" alone is not a primitive verb. Unless \"left\" here is part of a turn. Wait, perhaps the input is missing a \"turn\". Like \"run after turn left thrice\", but that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a typo for \"turn left\", and the correct command would be \"run left\" as in \"run in the left direction\", but according to the given rules, there's no such action. The only actions are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Therefore, \"run left\" is not a valid primitive verb. This seems like an inconsistency in the problem. But maybe the user intended \"run left\" to be parsed as \"turn left then run\"? But that's not a rule. Alternatively, maybe \"left\" here is a direction, and the intended action is to turn left and then run. But the rules don't specify that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, but given the input, we have to work with it. Maybe \"run left\" is supposed to be \"turn left\". Let's suppose that \"run left\" is a mistake, and the intended command was \"run around left\", but that's speculation. Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a typo for \"turn left\", but I can't be sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a command that combines running and turning left. But according to the rules, the only way to handle directions is via \"around\" or \"opposite\". For example, \"run around left\" would be four repetitions of turn left and run. But the input here is \"run left thrice\", which might imply that \"run left\" is equivalent to \"around left\", but that's not stated. Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a typo for \"run around left\". \n\nGiven that the problem is presented as-is, and assuming that the input is correct, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that \"run left\" is a verb phrase that requires a turn left followed by a run. Because that's how \"around <DIR>\" works, which uses turn DIR and verb. So perhaps \"run left\" would be interpreted as \"turn left then run\", similar to how \"around left\" would be four times turn left plus run. \n\nWait, but the rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"around\" is a modifier that combines turning in a direction and then performing the verb. But \"run left\" is not using \"around\" or \"opposite\", so how to parse \"run left\"? This seems ambiguous based on the given rules. \n\nGiven that the example uses \"jump around right\", which becomes turn right and jump four times, perhaps \"run left\" would be interpreted as \"turn left then run\", but that's not explicitly stated. However, if the input is \"run left\", according to the rules, it's not a primitive verb. So this seems like a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"left\" here is a direction modifier, but the verb is \"run\", so \"run left\" would mean the agent can run to the left, but according to the given rules, there's no action for that. So perhaps the input is invalid, but since the user provided it, we need to find a way to parse it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a mistake, and the intended verb is \"turn left\". Then \"run left thrice\" would be \"turn left thrice\", but that's not helpful. Or perhaps the user intended \"run\" and \"turn left\" as separate actions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a typo, and the correct command is \"turn left\", so \"run left thrice\" would be \"turn left thrice\", but again, how to parse that. \n\nThis is a critical ambiguity. Since the rules don't specify how to handle directional verbs that aren't preceded by 'turn', 'around', or 'opposite', perhaps the user intended \"run left\" to be a typo for \"turn left\". But that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the input is \"run around left\", but the user wrote \"run left\".\n\nAssuming that \"run left\" is a mistake, and the correct primitive verbs are in use, perhaps the intended command is \"run around left\", which would parse into four repetitions of turn left and run. But the user wrote \"run left thrice\". Alternatively, maybe \"run left\" should be \"run around left\", but again, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is to be treated as two separate verbs: \"run\" followed by \"turn left\". But according to rule 1, \"turn left\" is I_TURN_LEFT. So \"run", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The original command 'run left thrice after jump twice' is parsed by applying rules 4, 6, and 1 in order.

Then we process 'run left thrice'. 'Run left' means I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN. According to rule 4, 'thrice' means repeat this sequence three times.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, I need to process the command as per the rules. So maybe \"run left\" is not a primitive, but how to parse it?\n\nWait, the problem's first rule says that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So the primitives are \"walk\", \"run\", \"jump\", \"turn left\", \"turn right\". So if the command has \"run left\", that's not a primitive. Hmm. So maybe \"run left\" is a verb plus a direction. Wait, but how to handle that. Let's think.\n\nWait, the example input is \"jump around right\", which becomes 4 turns right and jumps. So \"jump\" is a primitive verb. So in the example, the verb is \"jump\", and \"around right\" is a modifier indicating repetition. So perhaps the structure is that the main verb is a primitive, and directions are modifiers. But in the input \"run left and look left thrice\", we have \"run left\" and \"look left\". Hmm. Are \"run left\" and \"look left\" considered verbs here?\n\nWait, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are only the ones listed. So \"run\" is a verb, but \"run left\" isn't. So \"run\" is a verb, and \"left\" would be a direction. Wait, but how are directions handled in the rules. The rules mention directions in the context of \"opposite <DIR>\" and \"around <DIR>\", where DIR is left or right. So maybe \"run left\" is not a primitive. Wait, but how to parse \"run left\". Maybe this is a problem. Because according to the rules, the primitive verbs are only the ones listed. So if the input has \"run left\", perhaps \"run\" is the verb, and \"left\" is a direction modifier, but how does that fit into the rules?\n\nWait, looking at the example given. The input \"jump around right\" is parsed as four I_TURN_RIGHT followed by I_JUMP each time. So the verb here is \"jump\" and \"around right\" is a repetition structure. So maybe the structure is that a verb is followed by a direction modifier, but only in certain cases like \"opposite\", \"around\", etc. But in the input \"run left\", it's not using any of the rules mentioned. So maybe \"run left\" is not a valid command under these rules, but the user is providing it, so I must parse it somehow.\n\nWait, perhaps \"run left\" is intended to be equivalent to \"run\" in a direction. But according to the rules, there's no mention of directions for movement verbs. The rules only handle turning. For example, the actions are I_WALK, I_RUN, etc., which are movement actions, but there's no indication that they can be directed. The turning actions are separate. So perhaps movement verbs don't take directions; only turning. Therefore, \"run left\" might not be a valid command. However, the input is given, so maybe the user intended \"run\" followed by \"left\", but left here refers to a direction. How to handle this?\n\nWait, maybe \"run left\" is a mistake and should be \"turn left then run\", but the user wrote it as \"run left\". Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a way of saying \"run to the left\", but according to the given rules, there's no way to model that. Therefore, perhaps the \"left\" here is a direction modifier for the verb \"run\", but since the rules don't account for movement directions, maybe it's a syntax error. But the problem is expecting me to parse this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a misinterpretation. Let me re-examine the input. The input is \"run left and look left thrice\". Wait, \"run left\" could be \"run\" followed by \"left\", but \"left\" is a direction. Wait, perhaps \"run left\" is equivalent to \"run\" and then \"turn left\". But how to determine that. The problem's rules don't specify that movement verbs have direction; only the turn verbs. So perhaps \"left\" in this context is a direction for a turn. So maybe \"run left\" is \"run\" followed by \"turn left\", but that's not stated in the rules. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"left\" is part of a different structure. Wait, the second part of the input is \"look left thrice\". But \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. The primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, this is confusing. The input has \"look left\", which is not a primitive verb. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Or maybe \"look left\" is supposed to be \"turn left\", but that's a stretch.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the agent is a semantic parsing agent for navigation commands. The rules list the primitive verbs. So if the input has a verb that's not in the list, then how to parse it? For example, \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. This might be a problem. However, given that the user provided this input, perhaps we have to assume that \"look\" is a typo, or maybe the problem expects us to map it to a turn action. Alternatively, perhaps \"look left\" refers to turning left. Because in navigation, looking left might involve turning. But according to the rules, \"turn left\" is the primitive verb. So maybe \"look left\" is equivalent to \"turn left\".\n\nBut the problem's rules don't mention synonyms. So unless there's a mapping from \"look left\" to I_TURN_LEFT, but according to the given rules, only the verbs listed in the first rule are primitives. Therefore, \"look left\" is not a primitive verb. So perhaps the input has errors, but we have to proceed. Alternatively, maybe \"look left\" is a mistake, and the correct verb is \"turn left\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look left\" is intended to be a verb, but not a primitive. But according to the rules, only the listed verbs can be used, so perhaps the agent should ignore it. However, given that the example uses the verb \"jump\", we need to handle this input under the rules. Therefore, maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps \"look left\" is a compound verb. But according to the rules, the primitive verbs are as listed, and the other constructs are built from those. For example, moving in a direction might involve turning and then moving. So if the command is \"run left\", maybe it's equivalent to \"turn left then run\". But according to the rules, how would that be expressed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run left\" and \"look left\" are typos, and the intended verbs are \"turn left\". But how to proceed. The problem's example uses \"jump around right\", which uses the primitive verb \"jump\" with the \"around\" structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is structured as \"run left\" and \"look left\", where each of these parts is a verb plus a direction. But the problem's rules don't specify how to handle movement in directions. The rules mainly handle repetitions and sequences. So perhaps \"run left\" is a verb followed by a direction, which is handled by rule 2 or 3. Wait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" equals 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb].\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a verb with direction left. But according to the given rules, the only way direction is used is in \"opposite\", \"around\", and as part of the turn verbs. So perhaps \"run left\" is not a valid command under these rules, but the user input is given. Alternatively, maybe \"run left\" is a misstatement for \"turn left and run\", but I need to parse according to some logic.\n\nWait, looking again at the example input and output. The example input is \"jump around right\", which is parsed into four instances of turning right then jumping, but since \"around right\" is rule 3, it's four times [turn right + jump], but the output ends with four turns right?

The input is \"look around left twice and jump around right twice\". \n\nFirst, I need to handle each part of the command according to the rules. Let's start with \"look around left twice\". Wait, the problem says that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. But \"look\" isn't listed in the primitive verbs. The primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Hmm, so maybe \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, the example given uses \"jump around right\" which maps to turning right and jumping four times. So the verb here is jump. So in the current problem, \"look\" is not a primitive verb. Does that mean it's ignored? Or is there a mistake here?\n\nWait, the user might have made a typo or included a non-primitive verb. According to the rules, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" isn't a primitive. But the problem says to process the command as given. Maybe \"look\" is treated as a no-op? But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a mistake and should be ignored, but the problem expects us to process it. Wait, the example in the problem uses \"jump\" as a verb. So perhaps the user intended to use valid verbs. Maybe this is a trick question. Or maybe \"look\" here is supposed to be a typo for \"jump\"? Or perhaps \"look around left\" is supposed to be parsed even though \"look\" isn't a primitive.\n\nWait, the rules state that \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the verb here would be the verb in the command. But if the verb is not a primitive, how to handle? The problem might have a typo. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\", but I have to work with what's given. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"You are a semantic parsing agent for navigation commands.\" The rules are given. So the agent must parse any command, even if the verb isn't in the primitive list? But the rules specify that verbs map to actions. So if the verb isn't in the primitives, maybe it's invalid. But since the user provided this input, perhaps there's an error, but we have to proceed. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\" or \"jump\". Let me check the example again. The example input is \"jump around right\", which translates to four turns right and jumps each time. So the verb here is jump. So perhaps in this system, only the verbs listed in rule 1 are valid. So \"look\" isn't a valid verb. But the input has \"look around left twice\". If that's invalid, but the problem expects us to process it, maybe it's a trick. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a typo and should be \"walk\", but I can't assume that. Wait, but the problem says to apply the rules. So if the input has a verb that's not in the primitives, perhaps it's not mapped. However, the problem says \"process this command\", so maybe \"look\" is treated as a verb that has no action, but the modifiers (around, etc.) are processed. But that's unclear.\n\nWait, but looking at the example again: the input \"jump around right\" becomes four pairs of turn right and jump. So the structure is \"verb around DIR\" which becomes four repetitions of turn DIR and verb. So regardless of the verb, perhaps we can parse it. However, the output needs to be a sequence of actions from the primitives. Since \"look\" isn't a primitive, how can we translate it? This is a problem. But maybe the user made a mistake, and the intended input was \"jump around left twice and jump around right twice\". Let me consider that possibility. But the given input is \"look around left twice and jump around right twice\".\n\nHmm. Since the user provided this, perhaps \"look\" is a typo, but given the problem's constraints, we need to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\", and the user intended to write \"jump around left twice and jump around right twice\", which would make sense. However, since we can't confirm, but the problem requires processing the given command, perhaps we should proceed as if \"look\" is a valid verb. But according to the rules, only the primitive verbs are mapped. Therefore, \"look\" would not have a corresponding action. But this is a problem. However, the problem's example uses \"jump\" which maps to \"I_JUMP\", so perhaps any non-primitive verbs are ignored. But then, how to process \"look around left twice\"?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore invalid verbs and process the valid parts. But that's not specified. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo and should be treated as \"walk\" or another verb. But I have to work with the given input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is a valid verb not listed here, but the problem's rule 1 is incomplete. Since the problem states that the rules are to be used, perhaps \"look\" is not a primitive verb, so the command has an invalid verb. However, the problem expects us to process it, perhaps considering that the user might have made a mistake. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is designed to test the parsing of the modifiers regardless of the verb. Even if \"look\" is not a primitive, maybe we proceed to parse the structure, assuming that the verb would map to an action. However, according to rule 1, only those verbs listed are mapped. So if \"look\" isn't there, we can't generate an action. But the problem's example uses \"jump\", which is in the list.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the input is incorrect, but we have to proceed with the parsing. Let's proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a typo and the correct verb is \"jump\", but then the input would have two parts with \"jump around left\" and \"jump around right\". However, according to the given input, it's \"look around left twice and jump around right twice\". Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to parse \"look around left twice\" as a sequence that would be four repetitions of turn left plus the action for look (which is not defined). But since \"look\" is not a primitive, we can't generate an action. This is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look\" is not a verb here but part of another phrasing. But according to the command structure, \"around <DIR>\" applies to a verb. For example, the example uses \"jump around right\", so \"look around left\" would be the verb \"look\" around left. But since \"look\" isn't a primitive, we can't map it. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to leave the action for \"look\" as undefined. But the problem's instruction says to output the sequence of actions. However, in the example, the output is all uppercase actions, so perhaps the system assumes that all verbs in the input are valid. Therefore, this input might have a typo.\n\nSince this is a problem given to solve, and assuming that the input is correct, perhaps \"look\" is intended to be a verb, but not listed in the primitives. However, according to the problem's rules, only those verbs in rule 1 are mapped. So this is a problem. But maybe we can proceed with the parsing structure, leaving the verb's action as \"I_LOOK\" even though it's not in the list. However, the rules state that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions, but other verbs might not. But the problem says to output the sequence of actions according to the rules, so perhaps \"look\" is invalid and we should ignore that part. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\". Let me proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a typo and the intended verb is \"walk\".\n\nWait, but the example uses \"jump around right\" which becomes a sequence of turns and jumps. So if \"look\" is a non-primitive, then \"look around left twice\" would have no action. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is treated as a verb that has no corresponding action, so the entire sequence would be just the turns and no verb action. But that seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is designed to test the parsing structure regardless of the verb's validity. So we can proceed to parse \"look around left twice\" as per the rules, even if \"look\" isn't a primitive. Then, the output would include actions like I_LOOK, even though they aren't in the primitives. But according to the rules, only the primitives are mapped. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user instruction says: \"Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions: walk→I_WALK, run→I_RUN, jump→I_JUMP, turn left→I_TURN_LEFT, turn right→I_TURN_RIGHT.\"\n\nSo only these primitives are mapped. Any other verbs are not mapped. So if \"look\" is a non-primitive verb, it's not mapped. So how do we process it? The problem states that the agent is a semantic parsing agent. So perhaps the agent's job is to parse the command into actions according to the rules, and if a verb isn't in the primitives, it's not recognized. So \"look\" would have no action. But then, \"look around left twice\" would involve the structure \"around <DIR>\" which according to rule 3 requires a verb. But the verb \"look\" isn't recognized. Therefore, this part would generate no actions. However, that would lead to a problem in parsing.

Combining the two using 'and' means executing the first full sequence followed by the second full sequence, which aligns with Rule 5. The only minor uncertainty is the inclusion of 'look' which is not explicitly defined in the primitive verbs list, but treating it as a valid action (I_LOOK) is reasonable in context.", "new_response": "None"}

The input is \"jump opposite left thrice and run thrice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part. Starting with \"jump opposite left thrice\". The rules say that \"opposite <DIR>\" means two turns in that direction followed by the verb. So \"opposite left\" would be two left turns, then jump. Then \"thrice\" means repeat that entire sequence three times. So each \"opposite left\" is two left turns and a jump, and doing that three times would be each cycle repeated three times.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the \"thrice\" applies to the verb sequence. Let me check rule 4: \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. But here we have \"opposite left\", which is two turns left, then the verb. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeat that entire sequence three times. Wait, the \"thrice\" applies to the \"jump opposite left\" part. So \"jump opposite left thrice\" means do \"opposite left then jump\" three times? Or wait, according to rule 4, \"around\" is a repetition of the turn and verb. Similarly, \"opposite\" is two turns then verb. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeat that whole action three times.\n\nWait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So for \"jump around right\", you do turn right, jump, four times. So the structure is for each repetition, you turn and then do the verb. \n\nIn this case, \"opposite left\" is two left turns then the verb. So the \"opposite\" part is the direction modifier. Then \"jump opposite left\" would be two left turns (I_TURN_LEFT twice), then I_JUMP. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeat that entire sequence (two turns left, jump) three times. Wait, but rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So each time the verb is called, you do two turns then the verb. Wait, but if \"jump opposite left\" is parsed as \"jump in the opposite left direction\", which would be two left turns then jump. So the entire \"jump opposite left\" would be two left turns and a jump. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeat that whole thing three times. So each repetition is two left turns and a jump. So for three times, that would be three instances of [turn left, turn left, jump]. Wait, but wait, \"opposite left\" is two left turns then verb. So each time you do two left turns and then jump. So for thrice, you do that sequence three times. So that would be (I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP) repeated three times.\n\nSo \"jump opposite left thrice\" becomes:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (first time)\nthen again I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (second)\nthen again I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP (third)\nBut wait, according to the rules, the \"thrice\" applies to the verb. Wait, rule 4: \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"jump around right\" would be turn right, jump, four times. So the \"around\" is a modifier on the direction, which defines a repetition. Then in this problem, \"jump opposite left thrice\": \"opposite left\" is two left turns then the verb. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeat that entire verb sequence three times. Wait, but \"opposite\" is a direction modifier which defines the action as two turns then the verb. Then \"thrice\" would mean to repeat the verb three times. But according to rule 4, \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb], which implies that the \"around\" causes a repetition. Similarly, \"twice\" and \"thrice\" would repeat the verb sequence. Wait, rule 4: \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"jump around right\" would be: turn right, jump, four times. So four times in total. The example given in the problem shows \"jump around right\" becomes four pairs of turn and jump. Wait, the example output is: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times, but in the example output, it's written as four times I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP, but the output given in the example is:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (since four repetitions, each with turn and jump. So four turns and four jumps, but the output is eight elements.)\n\nWait, the example output is four turns and four jumps? Wait, the example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT ?\n\nWait no, the example says:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT \n\nWait, wait. Wait in the example, the output is written as \"four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]\" which would be [turn right, jump] four times. So each repetition is turn and verb. So four turns and four jumps. But the example output in the problem statement shows:\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT \n\nWait, that's four turns and three jumps? Because the example ends with a turn. Wait, the example given is:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT \n\nWait, so the output is four turns and three jumps? That seems odd. Wait, the example shows that \"jump around right\" becomes four repetitions of [turn right + jump], which would be four times. So each repetition is a turn and a jump, so four turns and four jumps, but the output seems to have four turns and three jumps. Wait, let's count the example's output:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT \n\nSplit into tokens:\n\n1. I_TURN_RIGHT\n2. I_JUMP\n3. I_TURN_RIGHT\n4. I_JUMP\n5. I_TURN_RIGHT\n6. I_JUMP\n7. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSo there are four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, the example's output is missing a jump? Or perhaps the problem statement's example is a typo. Let me re-examine the problem statement's example:\n\nProblem says:\n\nExample:\nIN: jump around right\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, that's seven tokens. So four turns and three jumps? But according to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is turn and verb, which would be four times. So four turns and four jumps. But the example output has four turns and three jumps. That's a problem. So maybe the example is a mistake, or maybe the last turn is part of the four repetitions. Alternatively, perhaps the example is missing a jump. Hmm. But regardless, I need to follow the rules, not the example. Wait, but the example's output is given as correct. So perhaps the rule is that \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR] then the verb. No, the rule says \"turn DIR + verb\" four times. Hmm.\n\nBut regardless, moving back to the current problem. The example output is as given, but perhaps the key is that \"around right\" is four repetitions of [turn right, jump], which would be four times. So four turns, four jumps. But the example output shows three jumps. So perhaps the example is wrong, but maybe I should proceed according to the rules.\n\nBut maybe the problem's example is written with a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the \"around\" requires four turns and four verbs. For the current problem, the user wants us to process according to the rules. Let's focus on the rules again.\n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb.\n\nRule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb].\n\nRule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice; similarly for \"thrice\".\n\nRule 5: \"A and B\" = do A then B.\n\nRule 6: \"A after B\" = do B then A.\n\nSo, for \"jump opposite left thrice\", first parse \"opposite left\" which is two left turns then jump. Then \"thrice\" applies to this. Wait, the verb sequence here is the entire \"opposite left jump\". Wait, no. Wait, \"jump opposite left\" is the verb plus direction modifier. So according to rule 2, \"opposite left\" modifies the jump to mean two left turns then jump. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeat that entire sequence (two lefts and jump) three times. Wait, but according to rule 4, \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"jump opposite left thrice\" would be the verb sequence here is \"jump opposite left\", which would be the modified verb. But perhaps \"thrice\" applies to the verb, so the entire modified verb (opposite left + jump) is repeated three times. So each time, you do two lefts and a jump, three times.

Let me check the rules again.\n\nRule 1 lists the primitive verbs: walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" isn't among them. Then how to handle \"look around left\"? Wait, maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps \"look\" is a typo. But the problem requires processing this command. Wait, perhaps \"look around left\" is parsed as \"around left\" applied to \"look\". But since \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, how do we handle it? Hmm. Wait, the example input uses \"jump around right\" which translates to the four turns and jumps. So maybe only the primitive verbs are considered. Therefore, if \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, then this might be a problem. But perhaps \"look\" is part of the command and needs to be considered. Wait, but the rules don't specify what to do with non-primitive verbs. This is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look around left\" is a mistake and the intended word was \"turn around left\"? Or perhaps \"look\" here is a typo for \"walk\"? Alternatively, maybe \"look around left\" is a command that uses the \"around left\" modifier on the verb \"look\". But according to the rules, the primitive verbs are only those listed. So if \"look\" isn't in the primitives, then this is an invalid input, but the problem expects us to process it. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the user intended \"look\" to be a verb that can take modifiers. But according to the given rules, only the primitive verbs (walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right) are mapped. So maybe \"look\" isn't a valid verb. This suggests that the system should output nothing, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe \"look\" is part of a turn command? Like \"turn left\" is a primitive verb. Wait, \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitive verbs. So \"look around left\" could be a misparse. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\"? Or perhaps \"look\" is being used as a verb that's not in the primitives. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects us to proceed regardless. Let's assume that \"look\" here is a verb, even if it's not in the primitive list. Then \"around left\" would apply to \"look\". But according to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So for \"look around left\", the verb is \"look\", so we would do 4 times: turn left + look. But according to rule 1, the primitive verbs are mapped to uppercase actions. However, \"look\" isn't in the primitives, so how do we handle that? Maybe \"look\" isn't a valid verb, so the system can't process it. But the user provided this input, so there must be a way. Wait, maybe the user intended \"look\" to be a typo for \"walk\"? Or perhaps \"look\" is a different action not covered by the rules. This seems like a problem. Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a primitive verb, but the rules didn't list it. Or perhaps \"look around left\" is a command that only involves turning left and looking, but without knowing the mapping for \"look\", this is difficult. Alternatively, maybe the system ignores non-primitive verbs. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps \"look around left\" is a mistake, and the correct input should have been \"turn around left\". But given that's not the case, perhaps the problem expects us to proceed with the given rules, treating \"look\" as a verb, even if it's not in the list. Wait, but the example output uses I_JUMP, etc. So maybe any verb that's not a primitive is ignored. But that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps \"look around left\" is parsed as \"around left\" modifying \"look\", which is a primitive verb. Wait, but according to the given rules, \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, the system can't process it. But the problem expects us to process it, so there's a contradiction. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps \"look\" is a typo and the correct verb is \"turn left\". Alternatively, maybe the user intended \"look\" as a verb that's equivalent to \"turning\" or something else. Alternatively, perhaps \"look around left\" is supposed to be \"turn around left\" (which is a primitive verb) but there's a typo. But since we have to proceed with the given input, perhaps the assistant should proceed as follows: parse \"look around left\" as per rule 3, assuming that the verb is \"look\", but since \"look\" isn't a primitive, the system can't map it, but maybe the output would be some action. However, given the example, perhaps the correct approach is to treat \"look\" as a non-primitive verb and ignore it. But the rules don't specify that. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a mistake, but given that it's an example, perhaps \"look\" is supposed to be a verb. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that \"look\" is not a primitive, and thus the command is invalid, but the user wants an answer. Since this is a problem presented, perhaps the answer should proceed with the assumption that \"look\" is a primitive verb, and the mapping would be I_LOOK. But since the rules don't state that, maybe it's a mistake. But the example shows that even \"jump\" is mapped to I_JUMP, which is a direct mapping. So if \"look\" is a verb, then the action would be I_LOOK. But the rules didn't mention that. However, the example's input uses \"jump\", which is a primitive verb. So perhaps the system allows any verb, and maps them to I_<VERB> in uppercase. So \"look\" would become I_LOOK. But the rules state that primitive verbs are the ones listed. Hmm. Wait, the first rule says \"Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions: walk→I_WALK, run→I_RUN, etc.\" So perhaps only those verbs are allowed. If a verb isn't in the primitives, then it's invalid. However, the problem gives this input, which includes \"look\", which is a problem. \n\nAssuming that the user intended \"look\" to be a valid verb, even though it's not listed, then we proceed. Let's proceed under that assumption for the sake of solving the problem.\n\nSo \"look around left\" would be rule 3: around <dir> = 4 repetitions of [turn left + verb]. So the verb here is \"look\". So each repetition is I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK. So four times that, so:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK repeated four times. So:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK\n\nWait, but the example for \"jump around right\" gives four turns and jumps. So each time, you turn right then jump, four times. Then the turns are four consecutive turns. So yes, \"around left\" applied to \"look\" would produce four times [turn left + look]. So the \"look around left\" command would parse to that.\n\nThen the second part is \"jump opposite right twice\". According to rule 2, \"opposite right\" is two turns in right direction, then the verb. So opposite right would be two right turns, then jump. Then \"twice\" means repeat that entire sequence twice. Wait, rule 4 says \"A twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, but \"opposite right\" is a modifier. So \"jump opposite right\" would be the verb modified by opposite right. So \"jump opposite right\" is equivalent to two right turns then jump. Then \"twice\" would mean repeat that entire sequence (two right turns and jump) twice. So:\n\nFor \"jump opposite right\": opposite right → two right turns then jump. So sequence is I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP. Then \"twice\" → repeat this sequence twice. So:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP.\n\nNow, according to rule 6, \"A after B\" = B then A.

Or perhaps \"look\" here is considered a primitive, but it's missing in the rules. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" here is a mistake, but the user expects us to process it regardless. Wait, but according to the problem statement, we must use the rules provided. Since \"look\" isn't in the primitive verbs, perhaps it's invalid. But since the user provided this input, perhaps there's an error in their command. Or maybe \"look\" is supposed to map to something else.

But according to the rules, we have to map primitive verbs to uppercase actions. If \"look\" isn't a primitive, then perhaps we ignore it? But that would be a problem. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is supposed to be a typo for \"walk\", \"run\", or \"jump\". Hmm. Wait, but given that the user provided this input, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a valid verb. Maybe the user forgot to include it in the rules.

Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is equivalent to turning. Hmm, not sure. Wait, but in the absence of a mapping for \"look\", how can we process this? This seems like a possible error. But the user is expecting an answer, so perhaps there's an assumption here. Let's think again. Wait, the command is \"look around left thrice\". So \"look around left\" would be according to rule 3: around left would be 4 repetitions of turn left and look. So each repetition would be I_TURN_LEFT followed by I_LOOK (assuming \"look\" maps to I_LOOK). But according to the rules, \"look\" isn't a primitive. So unless \"look\" is a typo, maybe for \"walk\", \"run\", or another verb. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is intended to be \"turn left\"? No, that doesn't make sense. Hmm. This is a problem. But perhaps the user intended \"look\" as a primitive verb, and it's a typo in the rules. In that case, we can proceed under the assumption that \"look\" maps to I_LOOK. But since the rules don't list it, perhaps the correct approach is to ignore the command? But the user expects an output. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a mistake, and the intended verb was \"jump\" or another listed verb. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" here is supposed to be a turn command. But I'm stuck. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the input. But regardless, I need to process this. Maybe \"look\" is not a primitive verb, so it's invalid. But given that the example works, perhaps the answer should proceed assuming that \"look\" is a primitive verb mapping to I_LOOK. Even though it's not listed. Or maybe the rules are incomplete. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is equivalent to a turn, but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe \"look around left\" is equivalent to turning left and right, but that's not covered in the rules. Hmm. Maybe the correct approach is to proceed with the assumption that \"look\" is a verb that maps to some action. But according to the rules, it's not. Therefore, perhaps the answer should omit that part? Or maybe it's a mistake. But given that the user provided this input, perhaps the answer should proceed with the structure, using placeholders for the actions. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a verb that only turns. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" here is irrelevant to the actions, but the key is the modifiers. Wait, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs map. So if \"look\" isn't a primitive, then the command is invalid. But the user provided this input, so perhaps it's intended that \"look\" is a verb. Maybe the rules are not exclusive? No, rule 1 says \"primitive verbs map\", implying that there are other verbs. Wait, perhaps \"look\" is a derived verb. But according to the rules, only primitives are mapped. So perhaps \"look\" can't be processed. Therefore, this is a problem. However, the example uses \"jump\", which is a primitive. So perhaps \"look\" is a mistake, and the intended verb is \"walk\" or another. Let's suppose that maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\". But that's a big assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to include \"look\" in the primitive verbs. But given that it's not, perhaps the answer should proceed with the available rules, treating \"look\" as invalid. But then, how to proceed. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"turn left\" or \"turn right\". But that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is supposed to be an action that's not listed. However, given the problem's constraints, perhaps the answer should proceed with the rules and ignore the unknown verbs. But that would lead to no output, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended \"look\" to be a verb and it's a mistake that it's not in the list. So proceed as if it's a primitive verb mapping to I_LOOK. Then, \"look around left thrice\" would be processed using rule 3 and 4.\n\nSo, proceeding under that assumption:\n\nFirst, \"look around left thrice\": \n\n\"around left\" means 4 repetitions of [turn left + look], so each repetition is I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK.\n\nSo \"look around left\" becomes:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK\n\nThen \"thrice\" means repeat that entire sequence three times. So \"around left\" is a single unit (4 repetitions of [turn and verb], then thrice would repeat that entire around sequence three times. Wait, rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"around left\" is a verb here. Wait, no: \"look around left\" is the verb phrase. The \"around left\" is a modifier. So \"look around left\" is the verb plus around modifier, so according to rule 3, that's the 4 repetitions. Then \"thrice\" applies to that entire sequence.\n\nRule 4 says that \"verb twice\" is repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"around left thrice\" would be \"look around left\" thrice? Wait, no. The input is \"look around left thrice\". The structure is \"verb around left\" and then \"thrice\". So first, \"look around left\" is processed as per rule 3: 4 times [turn left + look]. Then \"thrice\" applies to that entire sequence, so repeat it three times.\n\nSo for \"look around left thrice\", the action sequence would be:\n\n[ (I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK) repeated 4 times ] and then this entire block repeated 3 times.\n\nSo each \"look around left\" is 4*(turn left, look), and thrice would make it 3 times that.\n\nThus, the total for \"look around left thrice\" would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK (x4) and then that entire thing thrice.\n\nSo:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK (this is once around left), then repeat that three times.\n\nThen, moving on to \"walk around right twice\" which is after. So \"walk around right\" per rule 3 is 4 repetitions of [turn right + walk], then \"twice\" means repeat that twice. So:\n\nEach \"walk around right\" is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK four times.\n\nThen twice would", "rationality_label": "Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The original response follows the defined rules accurately.

Or maybe the problem expects us to treat \"look\" as a verb that maps to an action. Wait, but the example uses \"jump\" which is a primitive verb. So perhaps the input here has \"look\" which we need to handle. Wait, but according to the first rule, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left/right. So \"look\" is not a primitive verb.

Let me re-read the problem.\n\nWait, the rules state that the agent is a semantic parsing agent for navigation commands. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left/right. So perhaps \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, the input may have a mistake, but as a student, I need to proceed. Wait, but the example uses \"jump around right\", which expands to 4 turns and jumps. So in this problem, \"look\" might be intended as a verb. But since \"look\" isn't in the primitive verbs, perhaps it's treated as a different action. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\". Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake. Wait, perhaps the original problem is correct and I need to process \"look\" as a verb. So assuming that \"look\" is a verb, then according to rule 1, it would map to I_LOOK. But the problem's example uses \"jump\", which maps to I_JUMP. So maybe the system allows for other verbs, but the rules only specify some. Hmm, but the rules don't mention other verbs. So perhaps \"look\" is invalid. However, given that the user provided the problem, we have to work with it. So perhaps the correct approach is to proceed as if \"look\" is a primitive verb, mapping to I_LOOK, even though it's not listed in the rules. Because otherwise, the problem can't be solved. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\". But the problem says \"look around left thrice after run right thrice\". So perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with \"look\" as a verb.\n\nNow, the command is \"look around left thrice after run right thrice\". Let's parse this. First, according to rule 6: \"A after B\" means B then A. So \"A after B\" would be B followed by A. Here, A is \"look around left thrice\" and B is \"run right thrice\". So first execute B, then A.\n\nBreaking down B: \"run right thrice\". \"run\" is the verb, so I_RUN. \"right\" is the direction. But \"run right\" would be a single action? Wait, no. Wait, \"run right\" would be the verb \"run\" plus the direction. Wait, but according to the rules, \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitives. So \"run right\" is not a primitive verb; \"run\" is a verb, and \"right\" might be part of a different structure. Wait, perhaps \"run right\" is a directional command. But according to the rules, the only primitives are the ones listed. So \"run\" is a verb, but \"run right\" could be a compound. Wait, but rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"run right\" here could be a simple verb, but perhaps the \"right\" is part of a different structure. Wait, perhaps in \"run right thrice\", the \"right\" is a direction for the run. But according to the rules, run is a verb, and turning is a separate action. So perhaps \"run right\" is not a standard command. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, looking at the example: \"jump around right\" becomes 4 repetitions of turn right and jump. So \"around right\" is a direction modifier for the verb. So perhaps \"run right\" here is a directional command, but according to the rules, \"run\" is a primitive verb. So maybe \"run right\" is equivalent to \"run\" in the direction right. But how to model that. Wait, the example uses \"around right\", which requires turning each time. Alternatively, perhaps \"run right\" is not a primitive, but the \"right\" is a direction to turn first. Or perhaps \"run right\" is a misphrasing, and the intended meaning is \"turn right then run\", but that's not stated. Alternatively, perhaps \"run right\" is a command that maps to moving right, which could be equivalent to \"run\" after a turn right. But the rules don't specify that. Alternatively, perhaps \"run right\" is a typo, and the intended command is \"turn right\", but that's not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run right thrice\" is a command to run to the right three times. But according to the rules, the \"run\" is a primitive verb. So \"run right\" would be a direction modifier for the run. But how? The rules don't mention direction modifiers for verbs other than \"around\" and \"opposite\". Hmm. Let's re-examine the problem. The example uses \"jump around right\", which is parsed as 4 repetitions of turn right and jump. So \"around\" is a modifier that applies to the verb. So \"run right\" here might not involve turning. Alternatively, perhaps \"run right\" is a directional run, which would be a single action, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are mapped to uppercase actions. So perhaps \"run right\" would be a different action, like I_RUN_RIGHT, but that's not in the rules. But the rules don't mention that. Therefore, this suggests that \"run right\" is not a primitive verb. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that \"run right\" is a misstatement and that the correct command is \"turn right\", but I need to proceed with the given input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run right\" is the same as \"run\" in the current direction, but the problem's rules don't clarify. This seems like a problem. Maybe the input is \"run and turn right thrice\", but that's not what's written. Alternatively, perhaps \"run right thrice\" is \"run thrice and turn right\", but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"right\" in \"run right thrice\" is a direction modifier for the run, but according to the rules, there's no such mapping. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake. But given that, perhaps we need to proceed by parsing \"run right\" as a single verb, but since it's not in the primitives, perhaps it's invalid. However, since the problem is presented, there must be a way to parse it. So perhaps \"run right\" is a mistake and should be \"run around right\" or something else. Alternatively, perhaps \"run right\" is intended to be \"run\" followed by \"turn right\".

The input is \"walk around left twice after walk left twice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the structure. The main structure here is \"A after B\", where A is \"walk around left twice\" and B is \"walk left twice\". According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B first then A.\n\nSo, let's handle B first: \"walk left twice\". The phrase \"walk left twice\" would be interpreted as walking left twice. But wait, according to rule 1, \"left\" as a direction in \"turn left\" maps to I_TURN_LEFT. But here, the verb is \"walk left\". Wait, wait, no. Wait, \"walk left\" would be a verb plus direction. Wait, the original rules state that primitive verbs map to actions. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Wait, maybe \"walk left\" isn't a primitive verb here. Wait, the problem says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\". So the primitive verbs are \"walk\", \"run\", \"jump\", \"turn left\", \"turn right\". So \"walk left\" is not a primitive verb. Wait, no. Wait, the primitive verbs are listed as \"walk→I_WALK, run→I_RUN, jump→I_JUMP, turn left→I_TURN_LEFT, turn right→I_TURN_RIGHT\". So \"turn left\" is a verb phrase that maps to an action, but \"walk left\" isn't listed here. So perhaps in the command, directions like left/right after verbs are part of the verb phrase. Wait, but the example given in the problem was \"jump around right\" which becomes I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times. So the \"around right\" implies that the direction is attached to the verb. Hmm, maybe I need to re-examine the rules.\n\nWait, looking at the example: \"jump around right\" translates to turning right and jumping four times. So \"around right\" applies to the verb jump. So perhaps \"walk around left\" would be similar, meaning 4 repetitions of [turn left + walk], according to rule 3. Wait, no: rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the verb here is the main action. So \"walk around left\" would be: turn left walk, turn left walk, etc., four times.\n\nBut back to the original input: \"walk around left twice\" and \"walk left twice\".\n\nWait, the B part is \"walk left twice\". How to parse \"walk left\"? Is \"walk left\" a verb plus direction, which would be a compound instruction? But according to the rules, \"turn left\" maps to I_TURN_LEFT. So \"walk left\" might not be a primitive verb. Wait, the problem's first rule says that primitive verbs map to the uppercase actions. The verbs listed are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Wait, wait, no: the way it's written, each primitive verb (like 'walk') maps to an action. However, the primitive verbs include 'turn left' and 'turn right' as separate verbs. So 'walk' is a primitive verb, 'turn left' is a primitive verb. Therefore, \"walk left\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, that's confusing. Let's recheck:\n\nRule 1 says:\n\nPrimitive verbs map to uppercase actions:\n\nwalk → I_WALK\n\nrun → I_RUN\n\njump → I_JUMP\n\nturn left → I_TURN_LEFT\n\nturn right → I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nAh, okay. So \"turn left\" is a primitive verb, which maps to I_TURN_LEFT. But \"walk left\" is not listed. Therefore, \"walk left\" would not be a primitive verb. Wait, but then how would you handle a command like \"walk left\"? Since that's not a primitive verb. Unless there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the direction after the verb indicates the direction for a turn, but not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the original command could have \"walk left\" as a command, but according to the rules, only the verbs listed are primitives. So if the command has \"walk left\", then \"walk\" is a verb and \"left\" might be an argument, but according to the rules, that's not covered. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, the example uses \"jump around right\", which is handled via rule 3. So perhaps the directions in the verb are handled via the rules. Maybe \"walk left\" is not a primitive verb, but rather \"walk\" is a verb, and \"left\" is a direction used in constructs like \"opposite left\" or \"around left\".\n\nWait, perhaps the command structure is such that the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So any other use of a direction (like \"walk left\") would be parsed as a verb followed by a direction in another construct. Wait, perhaps not. Let's see the input in question again: \"walk around left twice after walk left twice\".\n\nBreaking down the input:\n\nThe command is structured as \"A after B\", so B is done first, then A. So B is \"walk left twice\". How to parse \"walk left twice\"?\n\nWait, \"walk left\" is not a primitive verb. So perhaps \"left\" here is part of another construct. Let's look at the rules. Rule 2 is \"opposite <DIR>\" which equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Rule 4: \"verb twice\" is repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"walk left twice\" might be parsed as \"walk left\" which we don't understand, but perhaps there's a misinterpretation here.\n\nWait, perhaps \"walk left\" is parsed as \"walk\" modified by \"left\" in some way. But according to the given rules, how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"walk left\" is a misinterpretation and the actual parsing is that \"left\" is a direction in a construct. Wait, but the command is \"walk left twice\", which may be parsed as \"walk left\" twice? Or \"walk\" left \"twice\"? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps \"walk left twice\" is parsed as: the verb is \"walk\", modified by \"left twice\". Or perhaps \"left\" is part of a construct. Wait, \"twice\" is a modifier. Let's think. According to rule 4, \"verb twice\" is repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"walk left\" would be the verb sequence here, then repeated twice.\n\nWait, but \"walk left\" isn't a verb. Unless \"walk\" followed by a direction is a compound verb. Hmm. This is unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps \"walk left\" is equivalent to \"turn left\" followed by \"walk\", but according to the rules. Wait, but the problem's example shows that \"around right\" applied to jump leads to four turns right and jumps. So perhaps \"walk left\" is a separate construct. Wait, maybe \"left\" in this case is part of a different construct. Alternatively, perhaps \"walk left\" is a mistake and the intended command is \"turn left and walk\" or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the command \"walk left twice\" is parsed as \"walk, then turn left twice\", but that doesn't fit the rules. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps \"walk left twice\" is using \"left\" as a direction in a construct. Let's look at the rules again. Rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Rule 4: \"verb twice\" = repeat verb twice. Rule 5: A and B → A then B. Rule 6: A after B → B then A.\n\nSo the only constructs that use DIR are \"opposite\", \"around\", and the turn verbs.\n\nIf the command is \"walk left twice\", then \"walk\" is the verb, \"left\" may be part of a construct. But \"left\" here is not preceded by opposite, around, etc. Unless \"walk left\" is parsed as a verb plus direction in a construct. Alternatively, perhaps \"left\" here is a mistake, or perhaps \"walk twice left twice\", but not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps \"walk left twice\" is parsed as \"walk left\" which is a verb plus direction, but according to the rules, how? Alternatively, perhaps \"left twice\" is a separate construct. But I'm stuck here.\n\nWait, maybe \"walk left\" is a mistake, and the intended parsing is \"walk\" followed by \"left twice\", but \"left\" by itself isn't a verb. But according to rule 1, \"turn left\" maps to I_TURN_LEFT. So \"left\" alone can't be a verb. Therefore, \"left twice\" would be invalid unless it's part of a construct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"walk left\" is being interpreted as a verb and direction. Wait, perhaps \"left\" is part of a rule 2 or 3 construct. Wait, but in the input, it's \"walk left twice\", which may be parsed as \"walk left\" twice. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the command is \"walk left\" where \"left\" is a direction in a construct. Wait, but \"walk\" is not a directional verb here, the directions are for turning. So perhaps \"walk left\" is a misinterpretation, and the correct parsing is that \"left\" is part of a construct. Wait, maybe \"walk left twice\" is parsed as \"walk opposite left\" or something else, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"walk left twice", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 45, "model_reflection": "The original response misinterprets the structure of the command.

Wait, but the problem says I'm a semantic parsing agent for navigation commands, so maybe \"look\" is a primitive action? Wait, no, the rules say primitive verbs map to uppercase actions, and the examples given are things like jump, turn left, etc. So maybe \"look right\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, but the example given in the problem's example input is \"jump around right\" which maps to turning right and jumping four times. So maybe the verbs here are the primitives, and other actions like \"look\" might not be considered. Wait, but the user hasn't specified any other primitives.

The problem might have a typo, but since the user provided this input, maybe I should assume that \"look right\" is intended to be a primitive verb. Wait, but the rules state that the primitive verbs are exactly the ones listed. So maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is a different action, but according to the rules, the agent must process based on the given mappings. Wait, perhaps this is a trick question. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says \"You are a semantic parsing agent for navigation commands.\" The rules list how primitive verbs map. So, only the verbs in the list (walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right) are mapped to actions. Any other verbs (like \"look\") are not recognized. But in the input, we have \"look right after look right thrice\". So how to handle this? This seems like a problem. But since the user provided this input, maybe \"look right\" is supposed to be treated as a verb. Wait, but according to the rules, \"turn right\" maps to I_TURN_RIGHT. So \"look right\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, the agent should not process it. However, the user is expecting an output. Maybe the problem is designed to test if we can recognize that \"look right\" isn't a valid primitive, but perhaps the user intended \"turn right\" instead. Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is a typo for \"turn right\". But the user's example input uses \"jump around right\", which is a valid use of the primitive verbs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that \"look right\" is a verb phrase that maps to I_TURN_RIGHT. Because \"look right\" could mean turning the direction. But according to the rules, only \"turn right\" is a primitive verb. So unless \"look right\" is a primitive verb, it's invalid. But the problem's rules don't list \"look right\" as a primitive. Therefore, this seems like a problem. But maybe the user made a mistake in the input, and we have to work with it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is a compound command that is not a primitive. However, according to the rules, only the listed primitives are mapped. So the agent should not process other verbs. But the user is expecting an answer. Hmm. This is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and we need to proceed. Let's assume that \"look right\" is intended to be a verb here. But according to the rules, only the listed primitives are mapped. Therefore, \"look right\" is not a valid primitive verb. So the input would be invalid. But the user is asking for processing this. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to ignore this inconsistency and proceed as if \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\". But this is an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the problem intended \"turn right\" instead of \"look right\". \n\nAssuming that \"look right\" is a typo and should be \"turn right\", then the processing would be possible. Alternatively, if the problem is a test, maybe the answer should be based on the given rules regardless of the verb's validity.\n\nWait, the problem's example input uses \"jump around right\" and the output uses the primitives. So if the user's input has a non-primitive verb, maybe the correct approach is to ignore or fail, but the user is expecting a response. Therefore, perhaps \"look right\" is a typo, and the correct verb is \"turn right\". Alternatively, maybe \"look right\" is a primitive verb. But according to the rules, it's not. So perhaps the answer should be that \"look right\" can't be processed. However, the user expects an output. This is a dilemma.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\", given that in navigation, looking right could mean turning right. If that's the case, then proceed. But this is an assumption. Let's proceed under that assumption for the sake of solving the problem.\n\nSo the input is \"look right after look right thrice\". Let's parse this.\n\nFirst, \"look right\" → assuming it's equivalent to \"turn right\" → I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nThe structure is \"A after B\", which according to rule 5: \"A after B\" = B then A. So the entire command is \"look right\" (A) after \"look right thrice\" (B). Which would mean B then A.\n\nNow B is \"look right thrice\". Rule 4 says \"verb thrice\" = repeat the verb three times. So B is \"look right\" repeated three times. So each \"look right\" is I_TURN_RIGHT, so three times → [I_TURN_RIGHT] thrice.\n\nSo B is \"look right\" thrice: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the \"look right\" is the verb here. So \"look right thrice\" would be \"look right\" three times. Each \"look right\" maps to I_TURN_RIGHT, so three times → three I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nThen A is \"look right\", which is I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nThe entire structure is A after B, so B then A. So B (three I_TURN_RIGHT) followed by A (one I_TURN_RIGHT), resulting in four I_TURN_RIGHT. But wait, that's four turns right. But the problem's example shows that \"jump around right\" becomes four jumps and four turns right. Wait, but according to the rules, order matters. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the input is \"look right after look right thrice\". Breaking it down:\n\nThe main operator is \"after\", so the structure is: A after B = B followed by A. Here, A is \"look right\", B is \"look right thrice\".\n\nWait, wait: \"look right after look right thrice\" → the \"after\" splits it into A after B, where A is \"look right\" and B is \"look right thrice\".\n\nBut B is \"look right thrice\", which is the same as \"look right\" repeated three times (rule 4). Then the entire command would be B followed by A: (look right ×3) then look right.\n\nWhich would be four I_TURN_RIGHT in total. But according to rule 4, \"thrice\" applies to the verb sequence. But in this case, the verb sequence is \"look right\".\n\nBut wait, \"look right thrice\" would be \"look right\" done thrice. But according to rule 4, \"A thrice\" = repeat A three times. So yes.\n\nSo each \"look right\" is a single action. So three times would be three actions, then after that, another action.\n\nSo the entire sequence would be:\n\nB: look right thrice → three actions\n\nA: look right → one action\n\nTotal four actions.\n\nBut according to the rules, \"A after B\" is B then A. So yes.\n\nBut wait, \"look right thrice\" is B, which is three times \"look right\".\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nWait, four times I_TURN_RIGHT. But why? Let's check:\n\nAssuming each \"look right\" is I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nOriginal command:\n\nA after B = B then A.\n\nA is \"look right\" → [I_TURN_RIGHT]\n\nB is \"look right thrice\" = repeat \"look right\" thrice → [I_TURN_RIGHT] three times.\n\nTherefore, B followed by A is four I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nBut is there any other rule that affects this?\n\nNo, because \"look right\" is not a compound command. So the output would be four I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nBut the example uses spaces between actions.

So:\n\n[I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT] thrice → 6 actions.\n\nCombining both parts (A and B), we output all first part actions followed by second part.\n\nFinal output:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT", "model_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this navigation command step by step. The input is \"jump around right thrice and turn opposite left thrice\". Hmm, I need to break this down into the primitive actions according to the rules provided.\n\nFirst, let's parse \"jump around right thrice\". The structure here is \"jump around right\" modified by \"thrice\". According to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" means repeating [turn DIR + verb] four times. But wait, there's a \"thrice\" here. Wait, no, \"thrice\" applies to the entire \"jump around right\" action. Wait, no. Let me check the rules again.\n\nRule 4 says that \"<verb> twice\" means repeat the verb sequence twice; similarly for \"thrice\". So \"jump around right thrice\" would mean that the entire \"jump around right\" sequence is repeated three times. But first, I need to figure out what \"jump around right\" is.\n\nBreaking down \"jump around right\": according to rule 3, \"around right\" means 4 repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So the action sequence for \"jump around right\" would be (I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP) repeated four times. Let me write that out:\n\nEach around step would be:\n1. I_TURN_RIGHT then I_JUMP\n2. I_TURN_RIGHT then I_JUMP\n3. I_TURN_RIGHT then I_JUMP\n4. I_TURN_RIGHT then I_JUMP\n\nWait, but the example given in the rules for \"jump around right\" is:\n\nIN: jump around right\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the example output has four turns but three jumps. Wait, the example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, that's four turns right but three jumps. Hmm. Wait, because \"around\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. But in the example, \"jump around right\" becomes four turns right and four jumps? No, in the example, the output has four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP. Wait, let me check again.\n\nThe example input is \"jump around right\", output:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nThat's four turns right and three jumps. Wait, that's three jumps and four turns. Wait, how does that fit the rule 3? The rule says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is a turn and a verb. So four repetitions would be four times (turn + verb), resulting in four turns and four verbs (jumps). But the example output has three jumps. Wait, this discrepancy is confusing. Let me re-examine the example.\n\nWait, the example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nBreaking this down:\n\nFirst action: I_TURN_RIGHT, then I_JUMP.\n\nThen I_TURN_RIGHT, then I_JUMP.\n\nThen I_TURN_RIGHT, then I_JUMP.\n\nThen I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nWait, so there are three jumps here. But according to the rule, there should be four repetitions. Each repetition is [turn DIR + verb]. So four times: each repetition has a turn and a verb. So four turns and four verbs. But in the example, after the third jump, they do a fourth turn. Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps the example's output is incorrect? Or maybe the rule explanation isn't precise.\n\nWait, the example input \"jump around right\" gives output that ends with a turn. Let's count the number of turns and jumps:\n\n- I_TURN_RIGHT (1)\n- I_JUMP (1)\n- I_TURN_RIGHT (2)\n- I_JUMP (2)\n- I_TURN_RIGHT (3)\n- I_JUMP (3)\n- I_TURN_RIGHT (4)\n\nSo four turns and three jumps. But according to rule 3, it should be four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is one turn and one verb. So four times, leading to four verbs. But the example shows three. Hmm, this suggests that perhaps the rule as explained in the example is not matching the rule description.\n\nWait, maybe the example is correct, and the rule description might have a typo. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the rule. Let me re-examine the rule.\n\nRule 3 says: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is a turn followed by the verb. Then, four times that. So for \"jump around right\", that would be four times [turn right + jump], which would be four I_TURN_RIGHT and four I_JUMP. But the example output is three I_JUMP. Wait, so there's a discrepancy here.\n\nLooking at the example:\n\nInput: jump around right\n\nOutput: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn, Jump, Turn, Jump, Turn, Jump, Turn.\n\nThat's four turns and three jumps. Which suggests that after the four turns, there's a jump only three times. But according to the rule, each of the four repetitions should be a turn and a verb. So four verbs. So why is the example showing three?\n\nAh, perhaps the rule is not exactly as written. Maybe \"around\" is considered as a full circle, which would require turning four times but the verb is executed three times? Or perhaps the example is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the verb is applied after the four turns. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe the \"around\" rule is such that you turn four times, and each turn is followed by the verb. Except that after the fourth turn, you don't do the verb. Wait, but that complicates it. Let's see:\n\nIn the example, each turn right is followed by a jump except the last one. So four turns, three jumps. So the structure would be:\n\nTurn, Jump, Turn, Jump, Turn, Jump, Turn.\n\nWhich is four turns and three jumps. So perhaps the rule is that \"around <DIR>\" is equivalent to [turn DIR + verb] repeated 3 times, followed by a final turn DIR. But that seems arbitrary. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is that \"around\" requires 4 turns (to make a full circle) and 4 verbs. Hmm. This is a problem. Because according to the example, the rule's implementation is different than the description.\n\nIn this case, we need to follow the example's output. So perhaps the actual rule is that \"around <DIR>\" is 4 turns, and the verb is performed 3 times. Which would be:\n\nFor each of the first three turns, you do the verb, then the fourth turn. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is a typo. But given that the example is provided, we must follow it. So in the example, \"jump around right\" becomes:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_JUMP, I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nWhich is four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP. So the pattern is [turn, jump] repeated three times, then a final turn. Hmm. Which would not align with rule 3 as written. Therefore, perhaps the rule is not as described, but the example is correct. Which complicates things.\n\nBut given that the user has provided the example, we need to stick with it. Therefore, \"around right\" when applied to jump would be four turns right and three jumps. So the structure is [turn, jump] three times followed by a turn. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"around\" rule requires 4 turns (each 90 degrees, totaling 360) and the number of verbs is equal to the number of turns minus one. But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nIn any case, according to the example, \"jump around right\" gives four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP. So we have to model that. Therefore, the \"around right\" applied to jump would be:\n\nTurn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right.\n\nSo four turns and three jumps.\n\nGiven that, moving on.\n\nSo the first part of the command is \"jump around right thrice\". So \"jump around right\" is done three times. Each of those would be four turns and three jumps. So each \"jump around right\" gives us four turns right and three jumps. Then, since it's \"thrice\", we repeat that entire sequence three times. Wait, no: rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, but here \"jump around right\" is a compound verb. Then \"jump around right thrice\" would be repeating that entire compound action three times.\n\nBut according to rule 4, \"jump around right thrice\" would mean that the entire verb sequence (which is \"jump around right\") is repeated three times. So each \"jump around right\" gives the sequence from the example, and we repeat that three times. Wait, but the problem is that the example's \"jump around right\" already includes multiple steps. So the \"around\" is a modifier to the verb. So the structure here is \"jump around right\" is a single verb-like action, and \"thrice\" applies to that. Therefore, the entire \"jump around right\" sequence (which itself has four turns and three jumps) would be done three times.\n\nSo the first part would be three repetitions of the four turns and three jumps. So the first part's action sequence would be:\n\nFor each \"jump around right\":\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nRepeated three times.\n\nWait, but that", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The original breakdown correctly applies the grammar rules step by step.

The second part, 'turn opposite left thrice', was correctly interpreted as repeating 'turn opposite left' three times, and since 'opposite left' means two left turns, this results in 6 actions.

Hmm, first, I need to parse this step by step.\n\nThe main structure here is \"A after B\", which according to rule 6 means do B then A. So \"look opposite left\" is A, and \"walk left thrice\" is B. Wait, wait. Wait, the phrase is \"look opposite left after walk left thrice\". So the \"after\" connects \"look opposite left\" to \"walk left thrice\". So according to rule 5 and 6: \"A after B\" is B then A. So first do \"walk left thrice\", then \"look opposite left\".\n\nBut wait, the user wrote \"look opposite left after walk left thrice\". So the structure is \"look opposite left\" comes after \"walk left thrice\". So yes, B is \"walk left thrice\", then A is \"look opposite left\". So the overall sequence is first do B, then A.\n\nNow, processing each part. Let's start with B: \"walk left thrice\". \"walk left\" would be \"I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK\" (since \"turn left\" is a primitive verb, and \"walk left\" would involve turning left then walking, but wait, wait. Wait, the command is \"walk left\", but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are mapped directly. Wait, no. Wait, looking at the rules again. Rule 1 says primitive verbs map to actions. The examples are \"walk\" → I_WALK, etc. But \"turn left\" → I_TURN_LEFT. So \"walk left\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, the command here is \"walk left thrice\". Wait, maybe \"walk left\" is being parsed as \"walk\" followed by a direction modifier? Hmm, perhaps. Wait, in the example given, \"jump around right\" becomes 4 repetitions of turn right and jump. So \"around right\" applies to the verb. But perhaps in \"walk left\", the \"left\" is a direction modifier. Wait, maybe not. Wait, according to the rules, \"turn left\" is a primitive verb. But \"walk left\" is not listed as a primitive. So perhaps \"walk left\" is equivalent to \"walk\" in the left direction? But the problem is that according to the rules, the primitive verbs are the ones that map to actions. So maybe \"walk left\" would be interpreted as \"turn left\" then \"walk\"? Because if you want to walk to the left, you need to face left first.\n\nBut the problem is that the rules don't explicitly state that. The example given in the rules is \"jump around right\", which becomes four times turning right and jumping each time. So \"around right\" is a modifier on the verb. So perhaps direction modifiers after verbs are parsed as turn commands followed by the verb.\n\nWait, but the command \"walk left\" might not be a primitive. So perhaps the correct way to parse \"walk left\" is \"turn left\" followed by \"walk\". Similarly, \"run right\" would be \"turn right\" then \"run\".\n\nSo, \"walk left thrice\" would be: [turn left, walk] done three times. But wait, the \"thrice\" applies to the entire \"walk left\" sequence. Let's parse \"walk left thrice\". Rule 4: \"twice\" and \"thrice\" repeat the verb sequence twice or thrice. So \"walk left\" is a verb sequence. How to parse \"walk left\"? Since \"walk\" is a primitive verb, but \"left\" is a direction. Wait, perhaps \"walk left\" is equivalent to \"walk\" in the left direction, which would require turning left first. But according to the rules, direction modifiers are handled in the specific ways. Let's think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"walk left\" is a compound action. But according to the rules, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"walk left\" is not a primitive verb. Therefore, \"walk left\" would have to be parsed as \"turn left\" followed by \"walk\"? Because the only primitives involving direction are the turn commands.\n\nWait, the user's command includes \"walk left\". How to parse this? Let's look at the example given in the problem. The example input is \"jump around right\" which becomes 4 turns right followed by jumps. So \"around right\" is a modifier on the verb. So perhaps \"walk left\" would be parsed as \"turn left\" then \"walk\", as per the rules. Because \"walk left\" isn't a primitive verb. So the correct approach is to split into the direction modifier and the verb.\n\nSo \"walk left\" would be equivalent to \"turn left then walk\", so the action sequence would be I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK.\n\nSimilarly, \"run right\" would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN.\n\nSo applying this to B: \"walk left thrice\" → thrice means repeat the sequence three times. So the sequence [turn left, walk] repeated three times: I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK.\n\nNow, part A: \"look opposite left\". But \"look\" isn't a primitive verb listed. Wait, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left/right. So \"look\" may not be a valid primitive verb. Wait, but the input in the problem has \"look opposite left after walk left thrice\". Hmm, but according to the problem statement, the agent must process the command. But the rules don't mention a \"look\" action. This might be an error, but assuming that \"look\" is a typo or perhaps a mistake. Wait, but the example given in the problem uses \"jump around right\" which maps to the actions. So perhaps \"look\" here is a typo for \"jump\"? Or maybe \"look\" is a primitive verb. Wait, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" isn't in there. This is confusing. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is supposed to be \"turn left\" or \"turn\" in some way. Or perhaps \"look opposite left\" is equivalent to turning around to face the opposite direction. Wait, but the rules have \"opposite <DIR>\" as two turns in DIR. Wait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no: rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR, then the verb. Wait, no: the rule says \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, the example in the problem is \"jump around right\" → turn right and jump four times each. So how does \"opposite left\" work?\n\nWait, rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, that's ambiguous. Let me re-read rule 2. The rule says: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So if the command is \"jump opposite left\", that would be two turns left (since each turn is DIR), then jump. Because \"opposite left\" means two turns left, then perform the verb. So the direction is the turn direction, and two turns are made. So \"look opposite left\" would be parsed as two left turns (I_TURN_LEFT twice), then the verb \"look\". But \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the original command has a typo, and \"look\" should be \"walk\" or another verb. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\", but that's unclear. Since the user provided this input, we have to work with it. Let's proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is intended to be a valid verb. But according to the rules, it's not. So perhaps \"look\" is a mistake, but the user expects us to proceed. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is equivalent to a turn action. For instance, looking in a direction might involve turning. But this isn't covered in the rules. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look\" here is a mistake and should be \"jump\", but given that we can't ask the user, we need to proceed. Let's assume that \"look opposite left\" is \"turn opposite left\", which would be two turns left (since opposite left would be two left turns), then the verb. Wait, but the verb in rule 2 is the original verb. So \"turn left opposite\" would be two turns left, then the verb. Wait, the rule says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. So the verb here is the original verb. But in \"look opposite left\", the original verb is \"look\". So unless \"look\" is a verb that maps to an action, which it isn't, this would be a problem.\n\nThis seems like a contradiction. However, perhaps the problem intended that the verb is one of the primitives, and \"look\" is a typo. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the validity of the verb and process according to the rules. But according to the rules, the primitive verbs are the ones listed. Therefore, this input may have an error. However, given that the user provided it, we have to proceed. Let's proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\", which is a primitive verb. Let's proceed with that assumption. Alternatively, if \"look\" is supposed to be a turn, but that's unclear.\n\nAssuming \"look\" is supposed to be \"jump\", then \"jump opposite left\" would be two left turns, then jump", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 60, "model_reflection": "The original interpretation of 'look' as 'I_JUMP' is incorrect.

According to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" means 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb is jump and the direction is right. So each cycle is turning right then jumping.

The example output has 4 I_TURN_RIGHT and 3 I_JUMP? No. Let's see:\n\nThe example input is \"jump around right\", so according to rule 3: 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is turn right then jump. So four times:\n\nturn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump. So total of four turns and four jumps. But the example output shows that the last action is I_TURN_RIGHT. Wait, in the example given, the output ends with I_TURN_RIGHT. Wait, the example says:\n\nIN: jump around right\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, that's three jumps and four turns. Hmm. That's conflicting. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the example output in the problem statement shows that the command \"jump around right\" produces the sequence:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times, but looking at the output:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, this is four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP. Wait, how many repetitions? Let's see.\n\nThe first two actions are turn right then jump. Then again turn right then jump. Then again turn right then jump. Then again turn right. So the first three repetitions have both turn and jump, but the fourth repetition only has the turn. That doesn't align with rule 3. Wait, perhaps the example is wrong? Or maybe the rule is different. Hmm. Wait, the user's example says:\n\nInput: jump around right\n\nOutput: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP ?\n\nWait, maybe the example in the problem statement is a typo.

The problem statement's example shows that the output for \"jump around right\" is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, which is four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP. That would imply that \"around right\" is four turns, but three jumps. Which contradicts rule 3. So perhaps there's a mistake in the example? Or perhaps the rule is that after the four repetitions, you end up with the direction you started? Or maybe the \"around\" requires four turns but each turn followed by the action. Hmm. Maybe the example is correct. Let's see.\n\nWait, according to rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is turn DIR, then verb. So each cycle is two actions. Repeating that four times would result in 4 turns and 4 verbs. So four jumps. But the example output shows only three jumps. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Let's look at the example again.\n\nIn the problem statement:\n\nInput: jump around right\n\nOutput: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, that's three jumps. So perhaps the rule isn't exactly as stated. Or perhaps the example is a typo. Or maybe the rule is that \"around\" means \"until facing the original direction\", which would be four turns but maybe three actions? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the rule for \"around\" is that it's four turns in total, each followed by the action, but the original direction is restored. Let's think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is that \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of \"turn DIR then verb\", but each turn is consecutive. However, when you turn four times in a row in the same direction, you end up facing the original direction. So that's why \"around right\" would be four such steps. So each turn right adds 90 degrees, four turns make 360. But the verb is done four times. For example, \"jump around right\" would be:\n\nturn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump. That's four turns and four jumps. But the example output in the problem statement is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWhich is four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP. Wait, this seems inconsistent. Unless the problem statement's example is wrong, but perhaps the actual rule is that \"around\" is four repetitions of \"turn DIR then verb\", but the last turn is not followed by a verb. But that would complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement's example is correct. Let's count the actions in the example. The output has:\n\nTurn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right.\n\nSo four turns and three jumps. That would imply that the number of verbs is equal to the number of turns minus one. But how does that fit with rule 3?\n\nThis is confusing. But according to the problem statement, the example is correct. So perhaps the rule is that after each turn, you do the verb, except the last turn. Which would mean that \"around <DIR>\" is four turns in DIR, with the verb performed after each turn except the last. But that's not matching the rule description. Hmm.\n\nBut the problem's rule says that rule 3 is \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition includes both the turn and the verb. So four times each. So four turns and four verbs. Then why does the example output have three verbs?\n\nWait, the example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated three times, then another I_TURN_RIGHT. So total of four turns and three jumps.\n\nAh, perhaps the example's input was \"jump around right\", but the output is four turns and three jumps. Which contradicts the rule. Therefore, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement's example is a typo, and the actual intended output would be four verbs. Alternatively, perhaps the rule 3 is that \"around\" is four repetitions of the verb after turning, but the turn direction alternates? No, that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is correct and the rule is different. Let's re-examine the example:\n\nInput: jump around right\n\nOutput: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSo the output is four turns and three jumps. Let's count the number of actions: 7 actions. Each [turn + verb] repeated four times would be 8 actions. So perhaps the example is actually three repetitions and then a fourth turn? Which would not align with the rule. This is a problem.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the confusion is here. Let's check the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement's rule 3 says: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb].\n\nThe example input is \"jump around right\", output is the two-word actions repeated four times. But according to the output given, each repetition is [turn right, jump], but how many times?\n\nThe output in the example is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- First repetition: turn right, jump\n\n- Second: turn right, jump\n\n- Third: turn right, jump\n\n- Fourth: turn right (but no jump here)\n\nSo according to this example, rule 3 is actually four repetitions of \"turn DIR\", with the verb only after the first three? That's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is a mistake, and the actual intended behavior is that \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR then verb], but the output should have four turns and four verbs. However, given that the example provided ends with a turn right, not a verb, perhaps the rule is that \"around\" means four turns in DIR direction, each followed by the verb except the last. Which would complicate the rule.\n\nBut given the example, we must follow it. Therefore, the rule 3 must be interpreted as four turns in DIR direction, each preceded by the verb except the", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The original parsing followed the rules consistently.

The input is \"run around right twice and jump opposite right thrice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part according to the rules. Let's start with \"run around right twice\". The \"around right\" part means that for each of the four repetitions, I turn right and then run. But since it's followed by \"twice\", the entire around sequence is repeated twice. Wait, wait. Wait, rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Then rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" means repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"run around right\" would be the around sequence (4 times turn right and run), then \"twice\" would repeat that entire around sequence again. Wait, but the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the example given.\n\nIn the example, \"jump around right\" becomes four turns right and jumps each time. So \"around right\" is 4 times [turn right + jump]. Then if there's a \"twice\", the entire around sequence is repeated twice. So \"run around right twice\" would be doing the entire around right sequence two times. But wait, \"run around right\" already has the around as part of the verb. So \"run around right\" is the primitive verb modified by around. Then \"twice\" applies to that entire verb sequence. So \"run around right\" becomes 4 repetitions of [turn right + run], and \"twice\" would repeat that entire 4-step sequence again. So that part would be [turn right run] x4, then again x4, making total 8 steps?\n\nWait, no. Wait, rule 4 says \"verb twice\" is repeat twice. But \"run around right\" is a verb modified by around, which is a sequence of four [turn right + run]. Then \"run around right twice\" would be doing that entire around sequence two times. So each around is four steps. So \"run around right twice\" would be 4 repetitions of [turn right run] × 2 times. Which would result in 8 actions. Let me make sure.\n\nYes. So \"run around right\" is 4 repetitions of [turn right run], so each around. Then \"twice\" would repeat the entire around sequence again. So the first around right (run) gives 4 steps, then again another 4 steps, total 8 steps.\n\nThen the second part is \"jump opposite right thrice\". \"Opposite right\" means two turns in the right direction, then the verb. Wait, rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, wait. Wait, the direction here. If it's opposite right, then according to rule 2, we do two turns in DIR (DIR is right), so two right turns, then the verb. Then \"jump opposite right\" would be two I_TURN_RIGHT, then I_JUMP. Then \"thrice\" would repeat this thrice. So each time, two turns right then jump, and this is done three times. Wait, but wait: \"jump opposite right\" is the verb plus the opposite modifier. Then \"thrice\" would repeat that entire sequence three times. So each time, you do opposite right (two turns right, then jump), and do that three times. So each repetition would be two turns right and a jump. So three times that, leading to 3 × (turn right, turn right, jump) = 3×3=9 actions.\n\nBut wait, the \"opposite right\" is two turns right then the verb. So the verb here is jump. So \"jump opposite right\" is two right turns, then jump. So each instance of \"jump opposite right\" is two turns right and a jump. Then \"thrice\" would repeat that three times. So each time, two turns, jump. Three times: 2+1 each time, so 3×3=9 actions.\n\nThen the entire command is \"run around right twice and jump opposite right thrice\". According to rule 5, \"A and B\" means A then B. So first process \"run around right twice\" (A), then \"jump opposite right thrice\" (B).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFirst part: run around right twice.\n\nrun around right → 4 repetitions of [turn right run], so:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN (x4)\nSo the sequence for once around right is:\n\nTurn Right, Run, Turn Right, Run, Turn Right, Run, Turn Right, Run\n\nThen twice → repeat that entire around right sequence again. So total 8 steps of Turn Right and Run:\n\nTurn Right, Run, Turn Right, Run, Turn Right, Run, Turn Right, Run, Turn Right, Run, Turn Right, Run, Turn Right, Run, Turn Right, Run\n\nWait, no. Wait, the original around right is 4 repetitions of [turn dir + verb], so for run around right, that's 4 times [turn right, run]. So once around right would be 4×2 actions (turn, run), so 8 actions total. Then twice would repeat that entire sequence. So 8 actions ×2 = 16 actions.\n\nWait, but wait. The \"run around right\" is the verb modified by around right, which is 4 repetitions. Then \"twice\" would repeat that entire verb sequence twice. So each verb sequence is the around right run, which is 4 [turn right run], and twice would be doing that again. So the total would be 4 + 4 = 8 [turn right run] pairs. So each pair is two actions.\n\nSo the first part would be:\n\nTurn Right Run Turn Right Run Turn Right Run Turn Right Run (run around right once), then again Turn Right Run Turn Right Run Turn Right Run Turn Right Run (run around right again), total 16 actions.\n\nThen the second part: jump opposite right thrice.\n\nOpposite right is two turns right then the verb (jump). Then thrice means repeat three times. So each repetition of the opposite right jump would be two turns right and a jump, so each time: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP.\n\nSince it's thrice, three times that: three repetitions of Turn Right, Turn Right, Jump.\n\nSo each time, three actions. Three times would be 9 actions.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nFirst part: 8 [turn right run] pairs (twice around right) → 16 actions.\n\nWait, no. Wait, run around right is 4 repetitions of [turn right + run], so each around right run is 4*(turn right run) = 8 actions. Then twice would do that again, so 8*2=16 actions.\n\nSecond part: jump opposite right thrice. Each opposite right jump is two turns right + jump. Then thrice would repeat that three times, so 3*(turn right, turn right, jump) = 9 actions.\n\nNow, the entire sequence is:\n\nFirst part (run around right twice):\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN repeated 4 times, then again I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN repeated 4 times. So:\n\n(Turn, Run) x4, then (Turn, Run) x4.\n\nWhich would be:\n\nT R T R T R T R T R T R T R T R.\n\nThen the second part: jump opposite right thrice.\n\nEach opposite right is two turns right then jump. And this is done thrice, so each time T T J. Three times: T T J T T J T T J.\n\nSo combining all:\n\nFirst the 16 actions, then the 9 actions.\n\nFinal sequence:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nWait, wait. Let me check the count. The first part is 4*2 actions per around (each around is 4 pairs, each pair is 2 actions), so 8 per around. Twice → 16 actions.\n\nSecond part: each opposite right is two turns right, then jump. Then thrice → three times that. So each time 3 actions. 3*3=9.\n\nSo the final output should be:\n\nFor run around right twice:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_RUN repeated 8 times? Wait, no. Wait, 4 times for the first around right, then another 4 times for the twice. So total 8 pairs.\n\nWait, each around right run is 4 pairs (turn and run), so twice would be 8 pairs. So each pair is Turn and Run, so the first part has 8 pairs, which is 16 actions.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn Run Turn Run Turn Run Turn Run Turn Run Turn Run Turn Run Turn Run.\n\nThen the second part:\n\nEach of the three repetitions is two Turns and a Jump.\n\nSo Turn Right, Turn Right, Jump, repeated thrice.\n\nWhich is:\n\nTurn Turn Jump Turn Turn Jump Turn Turn Jump.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nFirst 16 actions of alternating Turn and Run, then 9 actions: Turn, Turn, Jump thrice.\n\nBut wait, the example in the problem statement for \"jump around right\" outputs four turns and four jumps. Let me check that.\n\nIn the example, the output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP.\n\nWait, no. Wait the example input is \"jump around right\", so around right means 4 repetitions of [turn right then jump].

But according to the problem statement, the rules are given, so maybe \"look\" is not a valid verb here. Or perhaps it's a typo.

Maybe the user intended \"look\" to be treated as a verb that's not in the primitive list. But according to the rules, how should I handle that? The problem statement says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\", so if \"look\" isn't a primitive, then perhaps it's invalid. However, the problem gives the example with \"jump\" which is a primitive. So perhaps the test input here might have a typo, but I need to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is supposed to be part of the command, but since it's not a primitive, how to handle it? Wait, perhaps the problem expects that the agent only recognizes the primitives and ignores other verbs? Or perhaps \"look\" here is supposed to be part of the action. Wait, but the rules don't mention anything about other verbs. This is unclear.\n\nWait, but looking at the example again: the input \"jump around right\" becomes four turns right and jumps. So \"around right\" is processed as four repetitions of [turn right + jump], which would be four times each, but the output in the example is four turns right and four jumps (each after a turn). So the example output is I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times. Wait, the example output is: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT. Wait, no, the example output has three I_JUMPs? Wait no: the example input is \"jump around right\", which according to rule 3: around right is 4 repetitions of [turn right + jump], so each repetition is turn right then jump. Then 4 times that sequence. So the output would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP four times, which would be four I_TURN_RIGHT and four I_JUMP. But the example shows four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP, and ends with a I_TURN_RIGHT. Wait, looking at the example:\n\nIN: jump around right\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, that's four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP. Hmm, that's odd. Let me count:\n\nEach repetition is [turn right, jump], so four repetitions would be:\n\nturn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump. But the example output ends with turn right. So in the example, the output has four turn rights and three jumps. Wait, that's inconsistent. Wait, in the example output, there's four turn right actions and three jumps. Wait, how? Let's see:\n\nThe output is: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated three times, then another I_TURN_RIGHT. So total four turns and three jumps. But according to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is two actions. So four repetitions would be 4 turns and 4 verbs. So the example seems wrong. Wait, the example output given must be incorrect? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the rule.\n\nWait, original example says:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nWhich would be \"around right\" being rule 3: 4 repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So each repetition is turn right followed by jump. So four times: turn right, jump. So four times each. The output should be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP.\n\nBut the sample output is missing the last I_JUMP. Hmm. The sample output in the problem says:\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWhich is four turns and three jumps. That's confusing. So perhaps the example is a typo, or I misunderstood the rule. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nRule 3 says: around <DIR> = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]\n\nAh, okay. So each repetition is first the turn DIR, then the verb. So for \"jump around right\", the structure is around right, which would be four times (turn right, jump). Then the total sequence would be:\n\nturn right, jump; turn right, jump; turn right, jump; turn right, jump.\n\nWhich gives 4 turns and 4 jumps. So the output should be: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP four times. Which would be eight actions. But the example output is seven actions, which suggests that the final jump is omitted. So perhaps there's a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe the 'around' rule is 4 times of [turn then verb], but the turns are four times and the verb is four times, but the example is missing that. But regardless, the current problem is to process the given input according to the rules, even if the example seems conflicting.\n\nBut back to the current input: \"look around right thrice after turn right thrice\"\n\nWait, but \"look\" is not a primitive verb. This is a problem. Unless I'm misunderstanding the rules. Wait, perhaps the problem's rule 1 lists the mappings but not an exhaustive list of verbs. So if a verb is not listed, like \"look\", how to handle it? The problem statement says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\", which suggests that there might be other verbs not primitive, but in the problem, the given examples and rules don't explain that. Maybe \"look\" is supposed to be treated as a primitive verb here. But according to the rules, the mapping is only for those verbs. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original problem assumes that all verbs in the input are primitive. But given that the user provided this input, which includes \"look\", perhaps there's a mistake here. But since the user wants us to process it, we have to proceed.\n\nAssuming that \"look\" is a verb that can be treated as a primitive, even if it's not listed in the example. So we can map look→I_LOOK, similarly for other verbs. The problem states \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\", but doesn't list all primitives. So maybe \"look\" is a primitive verb here. So proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, first, the command is \"look around right thrice after turn right thrice\".\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nThe structure is \"A after B\", which per rule 6: A after B means B then A.\n\nSo the entire command is equivalent to doing B (turn right thrice) first, then A (look around right thrice).\n\nSo first, parse B: \"turn right thrice\"\n\n\"turn right\" maps to I_TURN_RIGHT. Then \"thrice\" applies to the verb sequence. Rule 4: \"verb twice\" = repeat twice, similarly thrice.\n\nSo \"turn right thrice\" → [I_TURN_RIGHT] ×3: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nThen parse A: \"look around right thrice\"\n\nBreaking down \"look around right thrice\":\n\nFirst, \"around right\" is per rule 3: 4 repetitions of [turn right + look]\n\nSo each \"around right\" of the verb \"look\" would be:\n\n[I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK] repeated 4 times.\n\nBut then \"around right thrice\" – wait, the \"thrice\" applies to the entire \"around right\" sequence?\n\nWait, the structure of the phrase: the command is \"look around right thrice after ...\". So \"look around right\" is modified by \"thrice\". Let's parse \"look around right thrice\".\n\nRule 4 says: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. Similarly for thrice.\n\nSo \"around right\" would be a verb sequence (turn dir plus verb, 4 times). Then \"thrice\" would repeat that entire around sequence three times.

The input is \"jump right thrice and run around left twice\". I need to break this down into primitive actions following the rules provided.\n\nFirst, let's parse the command into parts. The main structure is \"jump right thrice and run around left twice\". According to rule 5, \"A and B\" means do A then B in order. So the command is split into two parts: \"jump right thrice\" and \"run around left twice\".\n\nStarting with the first part: \"jump right thrice\". The phrase \"jump right\" would normally be a direction, but looking at the rules, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Wait, \"jump right\" might not be a primitive. Wait, the primitive verbs are the verbs listed, and directions are left and right. Hmm, maybe \"jump right\" is a jump in a direction. Wait, but according to the rules, \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitives. But the verb here is \"jump right\". Wait, maybe the user made a mistake, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are the ones listed. Wait, the original example has \"jump around right\", which was parsed as turning right and jumping, repeated four times. So \"jump around right\" becomes four turns right followed by jumps each time. So in that example, \"jump\" is the verb and \"around right\" modifies it.\n\nWait, the original example input was \"jump around right\", and the output was four times [turn right, jump], then a final turn right. Wait, the output was I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times, but each repetition adds a turn. Wait, the example output is four turns and jumps, but the last turn doesn't have a jump. Wait, the example given:\n\nIN: jump around right\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, that's four turns right and three jumps? Or wait, the output has four turns and three jumps? Let me count:\n\nBreaking down the example output:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (first repetition)\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (second)\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (third)\nI_TURN_RIGHT (fourth turn, no jump)\n\nWait, the example output has four turns right and three jumps. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, the rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is turn DIR then verb. So four repetitions would be:\n\nturn DIR, verb, turn DIR, verb, turn DIR, verb, turn DIR, verb. So four turns and four verbs. But in the example output, the number of I_TURN_RIGHT is four, and I_JUMP is three. Wait, but the example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWhich is three jumps and four turns. Wait, that contradicts the rule. Hmm, maybe the example is incorrect? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, original example says \"jump around right\" becomes the output. Let me recount:\n\nEach repetition is [turn DIR + verb], so four times:\n\n1. turn right, jump\n2. turn right, jump\n3. turn right, jump\n4. turn right, jump\n\nSo the output should have four turns and four jumps, each paired. So output should be: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times. But in the example given, the output ends with I_TURN_RIGHT, not a jump. Wait the example output shows:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWhich is four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP. So that's inconsistent. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the example? Or perhaps the \"around\" rule is that after the four repetitions, you end up facing the original direction. Wait, but each turn would accumulate. Hmm, perhaps the example is correct, but the rule may have a different interpretation. Maybe \"around <DIR>\" is turn in DIR and do the verb, four times (to make a full circle). So each repetition is [turn DIR, verb], four times. So each turn adds 90 degrees, making four turns total (360 degrees). So each turn is followed by the verb. So four times [turn DIR, verb] would be 4 turns and 4 verbs.\n\nBut the example output has four turns and three verbs. Hmm. Wait, maybe the last turn is just to complete the circle, without another verb. So maybe after the fourth turn, you don't do the verb again. Or perhaps the example is a typo. But regardless, I need to follow the rules as written, not the example. Wait, the rule says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is turn and verb, four times. So four turns and four verbs. The example output, however, shows three verbs and four turns. So there's a discrepancy here. But perhaps the example is a mistake. Or maybe the rule is that after the four repetitions, you end with an extra turn. Hmm. But according to the rule, the example should follow that. So maybe the example is wrong, but regardless, I should follow the rule. Or perhaps the example is correct and the rule is different. Hmm. Maybe I should take the example as a guide. Let's re-examine the example:\n\nInput: jump around right.\n\nRule 3 says around right would be four repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So each repetition is a turn and a jump. So four times, leading to four turns and four jumps. But the output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated 4 times, but the example output shows three jumps and four turns. Wait:\n\nThe example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nBreaking that down:\n\n- Turn right, jump (1)\n- Turn right, jump (2)\n- Turn right, jump (3)\n- Turn right (4)\n\nWait, that's three jumps and four turns. So this seems like a problem. So according to the rule, the example should have four jumps. But the example output doesn't. That's confusing. Maybe the example is wrong, or perhaps the rule is different. Alternatively, perhaps \"around\" implies a full circle, which would require four turns (each 90 degrees) but after each turn, you do the action. So four turns and four steps. Hmm. Maybe the example is missing a jump, but as a parser, I have to follow the example's behavior. Alternatively, maybe the rule is that \"around\" is 4 turns and 4 verbs, but the example output is a typo. Not sure. But moving on, perhaps the key is that \"around\" requires four repetitions. So each time you turn and do the verb. So four times. So four pairs.\n\nNow, back to the current problem. The input is \"jump right thrice and run around left twice\".\n\nFirst part: jump right thrice. Wait, \"jump right\" is the verb here. Wait, but according to the primitive verbs listed, the primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump right\" is not a primitive verb. Wait, this is confusing. Wait, the primitive verbs are the verbs listed, and their direction variants. Hmm. Wait, the first rule says that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So the primitive verbs are \"walk\", \"run\", \"jump\", \"turn left\", \"turn right\". So \"jump right\" is not a primitive. Therefore, \"jump right\" must be parsed as \"jump\" with direction modifier, but according to the rules, how?\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump right\" is \"jump\" modified by \"right\", but according to the rules, direction modifiers would be handled via \"opposite\" and \"around\". Hmm, perhaps the \"right\" here is part of a direction modifier. Wait, perhaps \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"jump in the right direction\", but according to the rules, how to parse that. Alternatively, maybe \"jump right\" is a turn right followed by a jump. But the rules don't mention that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem here is that \"jump right\" isn't a primitive. The primitives are \"walk\", \"run\", \"jump\", \"turn left\", \"turn right\". So \"jump right\" is ambiguous. Wait, perhaps \"jump right\" is equivalent to \"turn right then jump\", but the rules don't state that. Alternatively, maybe \"jump right\" isn't a primitive and must be broken down. Wait, the example input was \"jump around right\" which maps to turning right and jumping four times. So \"jump\" is the verb and \"around right\" modifies it.\n\nIn the current problem, \"jump right thrice\": perhaps \"jump right\" is a command to jump towards the right direction, but according to the primitive verbs, we can't do that. So maybe \"jump\" is the verb, and \"right\" here is a direction modifier. Wait, but according to the rules, how to handle direction modifiers. Let me recheck the rules.\n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So, \"opposite left\" would be two turns left, then the verb.\n\nRule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb].\n\nRule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice.\n\nSo directions are \"left\" and \"right\", and the modifiers are \"opposite\", \"around\", and the other modifiers like \"twice\", \"thrice\".\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump right\" is", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The breakdown of 'jump right thrice' correctly applies the interpretation of directional jumps as a turn followed by the action, and 'thrice' correctly repeats that pair three times.

The input is \"run opposite right after look around right thrice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part according to the rules. Let's start by identifying the different components. The command has two main parts connected by \"after\": \"run opposite right\" and \"look around right thrice\". According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So we need to process \"look around right thrice\" first, then \"run opposite right\".\n\nStarting with \"look around right thrice\". Wait, \"look\" isn't one of the primitive verbs listed. The primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left/right. Hmm, but the example uses \"jump around right\" which translates to turning right and jumping four times. So \"around right\" is four repetitions of [turn right + verb]. But here, \"look\" is the verb. But according to the rules, the primitive verbs are mapped to uppercase actions. Wait, the rules say that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions, but \"look\" isn't in the list. Maybe \"look\" is a typo? Or perhaps it's considered a primitive verb? Or maybe it's a mistake. Wait, the example uses \"jump\", which is a primitive. The user's input here includes \"look\", but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, and turn left/right. So \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. That might be a problem. Wait, but the user provided this input, so I need to handle it. Maybe \"look\" is supposed to be a primitive verb, so perhaps it's allowed. Or maybe it's a typo for \"jump\"? Hmm. Let's proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a valid primitive verb here, perhaps the user added it. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake and should be \"jump\". But the example uses \"jump around right\", which works. Let's proceed with the given input as is, assuming that \"look\" is a valid primitive verb.\n\nSo \"look around right thrice\" would be processed as follows. First, \"around right\" means 4 repetitions of [turn right + look]. So each repetition is I_TURN_RIGHT followed by LOOK. Then \"thrice\" means repeat that entire sequence three times. Wait, wait. Wait, rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the \"around\" part applies to the verb. Then \"verb thrice\" would be rule 4 again. Wait, no. Wait, \"look around right thrice\" — the structure is \"verb around right\" and then \"thrice\". So \"look around right\" is processed first. Let's parse \"look around right\": that's according to rule 3: 4 repetitions of [turn right + look]. So the sequence would be [I_TURN_RIGHT LOOK] repeated four times. Then \"thrice\" applies to this entire sequence. Wait, but rule 4 says \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, \"verb twice\" is the phrase. But in this case, the phrase is \"look around right thrice\". So the \"around\" is part of the verb structure. So the entire \"look around right\" is the verb phrase, and then \"thrice\" applies to it. So according to rule 4, \"thrice\" would mean repeat the entire \"look around right\" sequence three times. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nRule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if the verb sequence is a complex one, like \"around right\", then \"twice\" would repeat that entire sequence. So in \"look around right thrice\", the \"look around right\" is the verb sequence, and \"thrice\" means repeat that verb sequence three times. So first, process \"look around right\" and then repeat it three times. But wait, \"look around right\" itself is already a sequence of actions. Let's break it down:\n\n\"look around right\" → rule 3: 4 repetitions of [turn right + look]. So that's:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT LOOK\n\nSo that's four turns and four looks, but each repetition is turn then look. Then \"thrice\" would take that entire sequence and repeat it three times. Wait, no. Wait, the \"around\" applies to the verb, so \"look around right\" is the verb sequence. Then \"thrice\" applies to that verb sequence. So \"look around right thrice\" would be equivalent to doing the \"look around right\" three times. Which would be three times the entire 4 repetitions. So that's 3 * 4 repetitions. Wait, but perhaps \"around\" is part of the verb, and \"thrice\" applies to the entire thing. Let me re-examine the rules.\n\nRule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]\n\nRule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice; similarly for \"thrice\".\n\nSo the \"around\" is a modifier of the verb. So \"look around right\" is the verb sequence that, when executed, is four repetitions of turn right and look. Then \"thrice\" would cause that entire sequence to be done three times. So the \"look around right\" is the verb sequence, so \"thrice\" would repeat it three times. Therefore, \"look around right thrice\" would be equivalent to doing the four-turns-and-looks three times. So the total would be:\n\n[ (I_TURN_RIGHT LOOK) x4 ] repeated three times. So each \"look around right\" is four times, and thrice makes it three times that. So total 12 turns right and 12 looks.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's check the example given in the rules. The example input is \"jump around right\" which outputs four turns right and four jumps. So that's exactly the four repetitions. So \"jump around right\" is four times. So if we have \"jump around right twice\", then according to rule 4, it would be two times the entire sequence. So \"jump around right\" twice would be 2 * (four turns and jumps) = eight actions each time? Wait, the example shows that \"jump around right\" becomes four turns and four jumps, ending with a turn. Wait, in the example output: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times. Wait, no. Wait the example output is:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, that's four turns but three jumps? Wait, wait. Wait, the example output has three I_JUMPs and four I_TURN_RIGHTs. Wait, that's confusing. Let me check again.\n\nThe example input is \"jump around right\" and the output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSo each repetition of [turn right + jump] is four times. Wait, how many times?\n\nWait, the output has four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP? No:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT \n\nWait, that's three jumps and four turns. Hmm, that's odd. Because according to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is turn DIR then verb. So four repetitions would be four turns and four verbs. So the example's output should be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP four times. Which would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP \n\nBut the example ends with a I_TURN_RIGHT without a jump. So perhaps the example is incorrect? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the rule.\n\nWait, the example output has:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated three times, then I_TURN_RIGHT once. Let's count:\n\n1. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\n2. I_JUMP\n\n3. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\n4. I_JUMP\n\n5. I_TURN_RIGHT\n\n6. I_JUMP\n\n7. I_TURN_RIGHT \n\nSo that's three I_JUMPs and four I_TURN_RIGHTs. Hmm, that's three repetitions of [turn right, jump], followed by a final turn right. But according to rule 3, \"around\" requires four repetitions. So the example seems to have a problem. Wait, perhaps the example is correct. Let me re-examine the example:\n\nInput: jump around right\n\nOutput: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated three times, then I_TURN_RIGHT again. Wait, how many total turns and jumps?\n\nThe output has four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP. Which is seven tokens. So four turns and three jumps. That doesn't fit with rule 3, which says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition would have a turn and a verb. So four repetitions would be four turns and four verbs. So the example's output seems to have three verbs. So perhaps there's a mistake in the example. Or maybe the final turn is part of the four, but the last turn doesn't have a verb. Wait, maybe the example is correct. Let me think again. If \"jump around right\" means turn right, jump, four times. So each turn right followed by a jump, four times. So:\n\nturn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump. Then finally turn right? No. Wait, four times:\n\n[turn right + jump] four times. So that would be:\n\nturn right, jump,", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The breakdown of the command follows the provided rules accurately.

The input is \"look right thrice and walk opposite left twice\". Hmm, first, I need to parse each part according to the rules.\n\nStarting with \"look right thrice\". Wait, \"look\" isn't one of the primitive verbs listed. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Oh, right! So \"look\" might not be a valid verb here. Wait, but the user mentioned \"semantic parsing agent for navigation commands\", so maybe \"look\" is a synonym for \"turn\"? Or maybe it's a typo and should be \"turn right\"? Hmm. Wait, the example given uses \"jump around right\" which translates to turning right each time. Let me check the rules again.\n\nRule 1 says primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So the allowed verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. \"look right\" isn't in that list. But maybe \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\"? Because \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are the primitives. So if the command says \"look right\", the agent should treat it as \"turn right\". So \"look right thrice\" would be \"turn right thrice\". Then according to rule 4, \"verb thrice\" means repeat the verb three times. So \"turn right thrice\" would be three I_TURN_RIGHTs. But wait, the original example for \"jump around right\" used four repetitions. Wait, no, the rule says for \"around <DIR>\" it's four repetitions. But \"thrice\" is three times. So \"look right thrice\" would be three I_TURN_RIGHTs.\n\nThen the next part is \"walk opposite left twice\". Let's parse \"opposite left\". According to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" means two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, wait. Wait, the rule says \"two turns in DIR then the verb\". Wait, no. Let me recheck: Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no: wait, the wording is \"two turns in DIR then the verb\". Wait, \"opposite <DIR>\" would mean that to get the direction opposite, you turn in DIR twice. So for example, if you turn left twice, you end up facing the opposite direction of left, which would be right? Hmm, maybe. So \"opposite left\" would be two left turns, then the verb. Wait, but the verb here is \"walk\". Wait, no. Let me parse \"walk opposite left twice\". So \"opposite left\" is the direction modifier for the verb \"walk\". Wait, no. Wait, the structure here is \"walk opposite left twice\". Hmm. Wait, according to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, so the entire action for \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR followed by the verb. But how does that fit into the command?\n\nWait, the command is \"walk opposite left twice\". Wait, maybe \"opposite left\" is the direction modifier for walk? Or is the structure \"walk (opposite left) twice\"? Wait, perhaps the user wants to walk in the opposite direction of left, which would be right. But according to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then do the verb. So \"opposite left\" would mean two turns left (which would make you face the opposite direction of left, which is right, assuming each turn is 90 degrees) then do the verb. So in this case, the verb is \"walk\". Then \"walk opposite left twice\" would be applying the \"opposite left\" twice. Wait, no. Let's parse the entire command.\n\nThe full command is: \"look right thrice and walk opposite left twice\". Breaking into parts:\n\nFirst part: \"look right thrice\" → parsed as \"turn right thrice\", which becomes three I_TURN_RIGHT actions.\n\nSecond part: \"walk opposite left twice\". So the verb here is \"walk\", modified by \"opposite left\". According to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" translates to two turns in DIR and then the verb. So \"opposite left\" would be two left turns, then walk. But the \"twice\" applies to the entire verb sequence modified by opposite left. Wait, the structure is \"walk (opposite left) twice\". So \"walk opposite left twice\" would be \"walk opposite left\" repeated twice. But according to rule 4, \"verb twice\" means repeat the verb sequence twice. So the entire \"walk opposite left\" would be the verb sequence that is done twice.\n\nWait, but \"opposite left\" is a direction modifier. So each time you do \"opposite left\" walk, which according to rule 2 would be two left turns then walk. So each time you do that action, you do two left turns then walk. So if we have \"walk opposite left twice\", then that would be twice of (two I_TURN_LEFT, then I_WALK). So that's two times [turn left, turn left, walk]. Wait, but how does that interact with the \"twice\"? So \"walk opposite left twice\" would be \"walk opposite left\" done twice, which according to rule 4, you repeat the verb sequence twice. The verb here is \"walk opposite left\", but maybe the \"opposite left\" is part of the verb.\n\nAlternatively, \"opposite left\" is a direction modifier for the walk. So the entire \"walk opposite left\" is equivalent to two left turns and then a walk. Then \"twice\" would mean doing that entire sequence twice. So each iteration would be two left turns and a walk, and that is done twice.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFirst part: look right thrice → I_TURN_RIGHT thrice.\n\nSecond part: walk opposite left twice. Each \"opposite left\" is two left turns and a walk. Then \"twice\" means doing that twice. So each \"opposite left walk\" is two left turns and a walk, done twice.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence would be:\n\nFirst part: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nSecond part: [I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK] repeated twice. So that would be I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK.\n\nWait, but the command says \"walk opposite left twice\", which is \"walk opposite left\" twice. So according to rule 4, \"verb twice\" repeats the verb sequence twice. So the verb here is \"walk opposite left\", which according to rule 2, is \"two turns left then walk\". Therefore, repeating this twice would be two instances of \"two left turns and walk\", which would be four left turns and two walks? No, because each repetition is two left turns and a walk. So two repetitions would be two left turns, walk, two left turns, walk.\n\nYes. So each time, you turn left twice and then walk. So the second part is:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK.\n\nThen combining both parts with \"and\", which according to rule 5, \"A and B\" is do A then B. So the first part is the three right turns, then the second part is the two left turns and walk twice.\n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK.\n\nWait, but wait, the command is \"walk opposite left twice\". Is the \"twice\" modifying the entire \"walk opposite left\" or just the \"opposite left\"? Let me think again. The original command is \"walk opposite left twice\", which could be parsed as \"walk (opposite left) twice\", meaning that the walking is done twice in the opposite left direction. Alternatively, maybe \"walk opposite (left twice)\", but that seems less likely. But according to the rules, \"verb twice\" means repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"walk opposite left twice\" would be the verb \"walk opposite left\" done twice. So the verb here is \"walk opposite left\", which is a single action sequence (two left turns and a walk). Then \"twice\" would repeat that sequence. Therefore, each repetition is two left turns plus walk. So two times: each repetition is two left turns and walk. So total of two times two left turns and a walk.\n\nSo the second part is:\n\nTurn left, turn left, walk, turn left, turn left, walk.\n\nWhich in actions is:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK repeated twice.\n\nSo yes, the previous conclusion is correct.\n\nSo combining all parts, the output is the first part \"look right thrice\" as three right turns, then the second part as the two repetitions of two lefts and a walk.\n\nThus, the final output should be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK.", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 65, "model_reflection": "The original response incorrectly interpreted 'look right thrice'.

The input is \"run opposite left and jump around right thrice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part according to the rules. Let's start with \"run opposite left\". Rule 2 says that \"opposite <DIR>\" means two turns in DIR then the verb. So opposite left would be turning left twice. Then the verb here is run. So that part should translate to two I_TURN_LEFT actions followed by I_RUN.\n\nNext, \"jump around right thrice\". Let's split this. The \"around right\" part follows rule 3: 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. The verb here is jump. So around right would be 4 times [I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP]. Then \"thrice\" applies to that entire around right sequence. Wait, wait. Wait, the \"around right\" already is 4 repetitions. Then \"thrice\" would mean repeating that entire around right sequence three times? Or does \"around right thrice\" mean that the number of repetitions in the around is multiplied by thrice? Wait, the wording in the rules says rule 4: \"around <DIR>\" is 4 reps of [turn + verb]. Rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is fixed at 4 repetitions, and then \"verb twice\" would be repeat the verb sequence twice. But the command here is \"jump around right thrice\". Wait, the phrase is \"jump around right thrice\". The \"jump around right\" is the verb phrase, then \"thrice\" applies to that. Wait, no: \"jump around right\" would be the around part. Let me recheck. \n\nWait, according to rule 4: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions. So \"jump around right\" would be the around right of the jump verb. So that's 4 times [turn right and jump]. Then \"thrice\" applies to that entire verb sequence, which is the jump around right. So \"jump around right thrice\" would mean that the around right sequence (which is 4 reps) is done three times. But wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions. Then rule 4's example shows that \"jump around right\" becomes four turns and jumps. Then adding \"thrice\" would mean that the entire around right (which is 4 reps) is done three times. So total of 4 * 3 = 12 actions? Hmm, no. Wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions. Then rule 4's example: \"jump around right\" would be four [turn right, jump] sequences. So \"jump around right thrice\" would be the entire around right sequence (which is four repetitions) multiplied by thrice? Wait, no. Wait, the wording in rule 4 says: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions. So the \"around\" is a modifier on the verb, which is equivalent to 4 times [turn dir and verb]. Then \"verb twice\" would be repeating that verb sequence twice. So in \"jump around right thrice\", the \"jump around right\" is the verb phrase with around, which is 4 reps. Then \"thrice\" would mean that the entire around sequence (the 4 reps) is done three times. Wait, but rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 reps. So \"jump around right thrice\" would be \"jump around right\" done thrice? Which would be 3 times the 4 reps? So total of 3 * 4 = 12 actions. Wait, but rule 5 says \"A and B\" is A then B. So in this case, the entire input is \"run opposite left\" and \"jump around right thrice\". So the first part is processed, then the second part.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nFirst part: run opposite left.\n\nBreakdown:\n\nopposite left → two turns left, then run. So according to rule 2, \"opposite left\" is two turns in left, then the verb. Wait, the rule says: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So the two turns are in the DIR specified. So if the direction is left, then two left turns. Then the verb is run. So the first part is I_TURN_LEFT, I_TURN_LEFT, I_RUN.\n\nSecond part: jump around right thrice.\n\nBreaking this down:\n\n\"jump around right\" is according to rule 4: 4 repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So each repetition is I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP, done four times → [I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP]^4. Then \"thrice\" applies to this entire around right sequence. According to rule 4, \"around\" is already 4 reps, and \"thrice\" would mean repeat the verb sequence (the around right) three times. Wait, rule 4 says that \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"around\" is a verb modifier that replaces the verb with a sequence of 4 repetitions. So \"jump around right\" is a verb sequence that is 4 repetitions of [turn right and jump]. Then \"jump around right thrice\" would mean that the verb sequence (which is the around right) is done thrice. So each around right is 4 repetitions, multiplied by thrice, giving 4*3 = 12 actions. Wait, but the wording for \"verb twice\" says \"repeat the verb sequence twice\". So \"jump around right thrice\" would mean that the entire around right sequence (which is four repetitions) is done three times. So each time, we do the four repetitions, and three times in total. But wait, no, maybe \"around right\" is a single verb modifier. So \"jump around right\" is a single verb with around right, which expands to four repetitions. Then \"thrice\" applies to that verb, so the entire around right expansion (four reps) is done three times. Therefore, the total for this part would be 3 times (4 turns and jumps), so 3 * 4 * 2 actions (each repetition is a turn and jump). Wait, no, each repetition in the around is [turn dir + verb], so each repetition is two actions. So \"jump around right\" is 4 repetitions of [I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP], which is 4 * 2 = 8 actions. Then \"thrice\" would mean doing that entire 8-action sequence three times, leading to 24 actions. But wait, the problem is that \"jump around right thrice\" could be interpreted as \"do the around right thrice\". But according to rule 4, around is a modifier that replaces the verb with a 4-repetition sequence. Then \"around right thrice\" would be... Wait, no. The \"around right\" is a modifier on the verb \"jump\". So the verb phrase is \"jump around right\", which becomes four times [turn right and jump]. Then \"thrice\" applies to that verb phrase. According to rule 4: \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"jump around right thrice\" would be the verb sequence (which is four repetitions) repeated thrice. So each repetition of the around right would be four, but wait, no. Wait, the rule says that \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So the \"verb\" here is \"jump around right\", which itself is a modified verb with its own sequence. So the entire sequence for \"jump around right\" is 4 repetitions. Then \"jump around right thrice\" would be to repeat that entire sequence three times. Therefore, each time you do \"jump around right\", you have 4 repetitions, and doing that thrice would be 3 times that 8-action sequence. Wait, but each around repetition is four times [turn and jump], so four times two actions each → 8 actions. Then thrice would be 3*8 actions? No, wait, the \"around right\" is the four repetitions, so each around right is 8 actions. Then \"thrice\" would mean doing that around right three times. So three times 8 actions: 24 actions.\n\nBut wait, the original example for \"jump around right\" would be 4 turns and jumps, which in the example output is four times. Then \"jump around right thrice\" would be 3 times the around right, which is 3 * 4 repetitions, leading to 12 repetitions of [turn and jump], which would be 24 actions. Hmm, but how does \"thrice\" apply here? If the \"around right\" is a modifier, then \"jump around right thrice\" could be ambiguous. But according to the rules, \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So the \"verb\" here is \"jump around right\", which is a verb modified by \"around right\". But the structure of the command is \"jump around right thrice\". So the \"thrice\" applies to the entire verb sequence. Therefore, the entire verb sequence is \"jump around right\", which is four [turn and jump], and then doing that thrice would be three times that four-repetition sequence. So each around right is done three times. But wait, no: the \"around right\" is already four repetitions, and \"thrice\" would add another repetition count. But the rules might have a hierarchy. Let me think again.\n\nThe input is \"run opposite left and jump around right thrice\".\n\nBreaking down:\n\nThe entire command is \"A and B\", where A is \"run opposite left\" and B is \"jump around right thrice\".\n\nRule 5: A and B means A then B.\n\nNow, B is", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The initial answer correctly breaks down the command using the provided grammar rules.

According to rule 5, \"A and B\" means do A then B in order. So I'll handle \"look opposite right\" first, then \"turn left twice\".\n\nStarting with \"look opposite right\". The word \"opposite\" here refers to the direction. Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" is equivalent to two turns in DIR, then the verb. Wait, but \"look\" isn't one of the primitive verbs listed. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Hmm. Wait, the user might have included \"look\" as a possible verb, but according to the rules given, the primitive verbs are only those five. Wait, the problem says \"Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions: walk→I_WALK, run→I_RUN, jump→I_JUMP, turn left→I_TURN_LEFT, turn right→I_TURN_RIGHT.\" So \"look\" isn't a primitive verb here. But the input has \"look opposite right\", which might be a problem. Unless \"look\" is a verb that's allowed.

So perhaps \"look\" is not a valid action here. But the example given in the problem uses \"jump around right\" which maps to turns and jumps. So how to handle \"look opposite right\"?\n\nWait, maybe \"look\" is a verb that's not part of the primitive actions. Wait, but the user provided this input, so perhaps there's an error here. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is supposed to be a turn action. Wait, but according to the rules, the only actions are the ones listed. The problem says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\", but \"look\" isn't listed. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but I have to proceed. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"turn left\" or \"turn right\". But given that the input is \"look opposite right\", perhaps the intended meaning is to turn in the opposite right direction. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is considered a verb here, but not part of the primitives. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the problem expects that \"look\" is equivalent to turning. But since the rules don't cover it, maybe this is a trick question. Alternatively, maybe \"look opposite right\" is a way to describe turning around, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"look opposite right\" should be interpreted as turning around to face the opposite direction. But according to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" means two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, but \"look\" is the verb here. However, since \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, maybe there's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a typo for \"go\" or another verb. But given the rules, maybe the correct approach is to ignore \"look\" since it's not a primitive verb. But that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a valid verb that maps to some action. Wait, the problem says \"semantic parsing agent for navigation commands\" and the rules are given. So the primitive verbs are the only ones that are mapped. Therefore, \"look\" is not a primitive verb. Hmm. But the example input was \"jump around right\" which maps to turns and jumps. So perhaps in the original problem, \"look\" might be intended to be parsed as a verb. Wait, but according to the rules, only the given verbs are primitives. So perhaps the input has a mistake, but I need to proceed. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" here is a red herring, and the actual action is to turn in the opposite right direction. Let me try to parse \"look opposite right\".\n\nAssuming \"look\" is a verb, even though it's not in the primitives. But according to the rules, the agent should map primitive verbs to the uppercase actions. If \"look\" isn't a primitive, then how to handle it? Maybe the problem expects that \"look\" is a non-primitive verb, but then we need to parse it. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake and \"look\" should be \"walk\" or another verb. But given that the input is as such, I need to find a way. Alternatively, maybe \"look opposite right\" is a way to turn around. Alternatively, perhaps the \"look\" is a typo and the correct verb is \"turn left\" or \"turn right\". But without further info, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a verb here, and perhaps it's not in the primitives. But that would make the input invalid. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is equivalent to a turn action. For example, looking in a direction might involve turning. Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"look opposite right\" is a compound command. Let's parse \"opposite right\". According to rule 2, \"opposite right\" would mean two turns to the right (I_TURN_RIGHT twice), and then the verb. But the verb here is \"look\". However, \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. Hmm. This seems like a problem. Maybe there's a mistake in the input, but as a parser, I have to work with it. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a verb that's not in the primitive list. Then, the parser can't process it and should output an error. But the problem seems to expect a valid output. Therefore, perhaps \"look\" is a typo. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" here is meant to be ignored, but that's not likely.\n\nWait, maybe \"look opposite right\" is a way to say \"turn around\". Because looking opposite direction could be turning 180 degrees. Which would be two turns. For example, if you're facing north, opposite right (assuming right is east) would be west, so to look opposite right would be to face west, which would require a single turn right (from north to east, then another to south, but wait, no). Hmm, perhaps this line of thinking isn't helpful. Alternatively, maybe \"look opposite right\" should be parsed as \"opposite right\" modifying the verb. Wait, according to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. So the structure is \"verb opposite DIR\", which would be equivalent to two turns in DIR, then the verb. But in this case, the input is \"look opposite right\". So the verb is \"look\", modified by \"opposite right\". But since \"look\" isn't a primitive, perhaps the problem expects that we treat \"look\" as a valid verb. But according to the rules, only the primitives are mapped. So perhaps the answer would be invalid. But the user provided this input, so there must be a solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look\" here is a misstatement, and the intended verb is \"turn left\" or \"turn right\". But that's just speculation. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\" or another verb. But given that the user provided this input, perhaps the intended approach is to proceed with the rules as written.\n\nWait, maybe \"look\" is a verb that's not in the primitive list. Then, according to the rules, we can't map it. But the problem seems to require an answer. Therefore, perhaps the user intended \"look\" to be a primitive verb, but it's missing. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a mistake and the correct verb is \"turn left\". Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that \"look\" is equivalent to turning. But this is unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and \"look\" should be \"walk\". However, given the input, I need to process it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"look opposite right\" is a command where \"look\" is a verb that requires turning, but since it's not a primitive, perhaps the parser ignores it and only processes the \"opposite right\" part. But that's not according to the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look opposite right\" is parsed as follows: \"look\" is the verb, and \"opposite right\" is the modifier. According to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" becomes two turns in DIR followed by the verb. So regardless of the verb, as long as it's a primitive, then we can process it. But \"look\" isn't a primitive, so this would be invalid. However, the user expects an output. Therefore, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is part of the direction. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look opposite right\" is a mistake and should be \"turn opposite right\". Then, the verb is \"turn\", but according to the rules, the primitives are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". So \"turn\" alone isn't a primitive verb. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"look\" is a mistake and the correct input should be \"walk opposite right and turn left twice\". But assuming that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that \"look\" is equivalent to \"turn left\", but I have no basis for that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is a verb that requires no action, but that's unlikely. \n\nThis seems like a dead end. Let's try to think differently. Maybe \"look opposite right\" is a command that requires turning around to face the opposite direction. But how to map that.

The user wants me to process \"walk opposite right twice and jump opposite right\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part according to the rules. Starting with \"walk opposite right twice\". The \"opposite right\" part means two turns to the right, then the verb. So opposite right would be two I_TURN_RIGHT actions followed by the verb, which is walk here. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the structure is \"verb opposite right twice\". Wait, the original phrase is \"walk opposite right twice\". So the \"opposite right\" applies to the walk action. Let me re-express that.\n\nRule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no, the wording is: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Hmm, wait. Wait the rule says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, so if the command is \"walk opposite right\", that would be two turns to the right, then walk. Wait, but the example in the problem is \"jump around right\" which becomes four times [turn right and jump], so the structure is different. Let me check the rules again.\n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So the verb would be the primitive verb. So for example, if the command is \"walk opposite left\", then opposite left would be two turns left, then walk. So the sequence would be I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK. \n\nSo in the current case, \"walk opposite right twice\". The \"opposite right\" is two turns right, then walk. But then \"twice\" applies to the sequence. Wait, the command is \"walk opposite right twice\". So \"walk opposite right\" is the action, and \"twice\" means to repeat that sequence twice. Wait, but need to parse the structure.\n\nThe phrase is \"walk opposite right twice and jump opposite right\". Breaking into parts:\n\nPart 1: \"walk opposite right twice\"\n\nPart 2: \"jump opposite right\"\n\nCombined with \"and\", so rule 5: A and B = do A then B.\n\nSo first, process \"walk opposite right twice\". \n\n\"walk opposite right\" would be according to \"opposite right\" modifying walk. So according to rule 2, opposite right is two turns right then the verb (walk). So the sequence for \"walk opposite right\" would be two right turns, then walk: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK. But wait, wait the wording in rule 2 is \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, wait, no. Wait the rule says \"opposite <DIR>\" is equivalent to two turns in DIR followed by the verb. Wait, wait. Wait, the rule says that \"opposite <DIR>\" is equivalent to two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, but which verb? The verb in the original command. For example, if the command is \"walk opposite right\", then \"opposite right\" means two turns right then walk. So the action sequence would be two turns right, then walk. So that's I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK. Then \"twice\" applies to that entire sequence. So \"walk opposite right twice\" would be the sequence for walk opposite right (turn right twice, walk) and then repeat that once more. So each time, two turns, walk, then again two turns, walk. Wait, but the \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. Rule 4 says \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So in the case of \"walk opposite right twice\", the entire action sequence for \"walk opposite right\" is the verb sequence, which is turn right twice and walk. Then \"twice\" would mean to do that twice. Wait, but \"twice\" would apply to the entire verb sequence. So the \"verb\" here is \"walk opposite right\", which is the primitive verb modified by opposite. So according to rule 4, \"walk opposite right twice\" would be to do the sequence once, then again. So each time, two turns right and walk. So total twice. Therefore, the first part would be [I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK] repeated twice. So the first part is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK\n\nThen the second part of the command is \"jump opposite right\", which would be \"jump opposite right\", so again opposite right for jump: two turns right, then jump. So I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP.\n\nPutting it all together, since the command is \"A and B\", which is A then B. So the entire sequence is first part (walk opposite right twice), then jump opposite right.\n\nWait, but wait, the \"and\" combines the two parts. So the entire sequence would be:\n\nWalk opposite right twice → two times (turn right twice, walk) → then jump opposite right (turn right twice, jump).\n\nSo the actions would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK (first time)\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK (second time)\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (jump opposite right)\n\nPutting all together separated by spaces:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let's check the command again:\n\nIN: walk opposite right twice and jump opposite right.\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- \"walk opposite right\" twice: each instance of the action is two right turns and walk. So twice → two repetitions. So each time, two turns, then walk. So first action: turn right, turn right, walk. Second time: turn right, turn right, walk. Then jump opposite right → turn right, turn right, jump.\n\nSo the total sequence is:\n\nTurn right, turn right, walk, turn right, turn right, walk, turn right, turn right, jump.\n\nExpressed as:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWait, but the rule for \"opposite <DIR>\" says that \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. So each occurrence of \"opposite right\" is two turns then verb.\n\nYes. So each time \"walk opposite right\" is two turns right, then walk.\n\nThen \"twice\" applies to that entire verb sequence. So \"walk opposite right twice\" would be to do the verb sequence (two turns and walk) twice. So two times that sequence.\n\nThen \"jump opposite right\" is two turns and jump.\n\nCombined with \"and\", so order A then B.\n\nTherefore, the entire action sequence should be:\n\n[Turn right, turn right, walk] ×2 followed by [turn right, turn right, jump]\n\nWhich is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK (first part)\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK (second part)\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (third part)\n\nCombined:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nWait, but wait, the example in the problem statement: jump around right becomes [turn right, jump] four times. So \"around right\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb], so the example is four times each of turn right then jump, then the final turn right. Wait, the example output is I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP ... four times the pair, but the example shows four pairs separated by spaces, but in the example output it's written as four pairs plus the last turn. Wait the example input is \"jump around right\" which according to rule 3 should be 4 repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So each repetition is turn right, jump. So four times that, which would be turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump. Then after four repetitions, do we need another turn right? The example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT ?\n\nWait, no, the example's output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT \n\nWait, wait, the example input was \"jump around right\", and the output was:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT ?\n\nWait no, the example output is written as:\n\n\"I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\"\n\nWait, the example output given in the problem is:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, but according to rule 3, around <DIR> is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So four times [turn right + jump], which would be:\n\nturn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump.\n\nWhich would be 4 pairs. Then why the example output has three I_TURN_RIGHT and four I_JUMP? Wait, the example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, that's four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP?\n\nWait, no, let's count:\n\nSequence:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (1)\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (2)\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (3)\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT (4th turn?)\n\nWait, that", "rationality_label": "Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The original response correctly interprets the command using the given rules.

But wait, \"look\" isn't a primitive verb listed in the rules. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Hmm, maybe \"look\" isn't an action here. Wait, the example uses \"jump around right\" which translates to turning right each time then jumping. So \"around left\" would be 4 repetitions of [turn left + verb]. But the verb here is \"look\". However, the primitive verbs map to specific actions. But \"look\" isn't one of them. Wait, maybe the problem is that \"look\" isn't a primitive verb.

But the problem might expect us to process it regardless. Or perhaps \"look\" is a typo. Hmm. But maybe the user intended \"look\" to be a verb. Wait, but according to the rules, only the listed primitives are used. Therefore, \"look\" isn't a valid verb, so maybe that part is skipped? Or perhaps the problem expects that \"look\" is not an action, so maybe the command is invalid. Wait, but the example uses jump, which is valid. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the example input is \"jump around right\", which outputs the sequence of turns and jumps. So the verb must be a primitive verb. Therefore, \"look\" here is not a primitive verb. So perhaps the command is invalid. But the problem gives this as input, so maybe \"look\" should be ignored, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is meant to be a placeholder, but according to the rules, it's not a primitive verb. Therefore, perhaps the \"look around left twice\" part would translate to \"around left\" which is four repetitions of turn left and the verb. Since \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, but the rules require using the primitive verbs, maybe this is a trick. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended \"look\" to be a typo for \"walk\" or another verb. But given the input, I need to process it.\n\nWait, perhaps \"look\" is not an action. Then, \"around left\" would be four repetitions of turn left plus the verb. But the verb here is \"look\", which isn't an action. So maybe the entire \"look around left twice\" part would result in no actions except the turn lefts? But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\", but I can't assume that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a direction. Wait, no. Directions are left and right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects that \"look\" is not a primitive verb, so it's ignored, but according to the rules, we must parse it. Wait, the problem says \"semantic parsing agent for navigation commands\", which implies that the input is valid. So perhaps \"look\" here is a mistake, but since the problem gives it, I have to figure it out. Maybe in this context, \"look\" is equivalent to \"turn\". Wait, but according to the rules, the verbs are the ones listed. So perhaps \"look\" is treated as an invalid command. However, the problem expects an answer. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is supposed to be \"walk\", but that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look around left\" is a way to say turn left multiple times. But according to rule 3, \"around left\" is four repetitions of [turn left + verb]. So if the verb is \"look\", which isn't a primitive, then the verb would map to nothing. Therefore, the action sequence would have four turns left and four \"look\" (but \"look\" isn't a valid action). But according to the rules, only the primitive verbs are converted. Therefore, perhaps \"look\" is ignored. But that complicates things. Maybe the problem expects us to process \"look\" as if it's a valid verb, even though it's not listed. Or maybe there's a mistake in the problem's input. But given the problem's statement, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a typo. Wait, but the user provided that input and expects an answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look around left\" is just a way to say \"turn left\", but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a non-action, and the command is invalid. But the problem expects us to process it. Hmm. Maybe the key is that \"look around left\" would involve turning, but since \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, the verb part doesn't generate any action. So \"around left\" would be four repetitions of [turn left] followed by the verb. If the verb is invalid, then we just have the turns. But according to the rules, each \"around left\" would have four turns left and four verbs. But if the verb isn't a primitive, then perhaps the verb part is skipped. Therefore, \"look around left\" would become four times [turn left], but then \"around left\" requires the verb. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the verb is \"turn left\", but that's not the case. Let me re-examine the problem. The user's example: input \"jump around right\" produces four turns right and four jumps. So \"around right\" is four times [turn right + jump]. Therefore, the structure is [turn dir + verb] repeated four times. So in \"look around left\", the verb is \"look\", which is not a primitive verb. Therefore, according to the rules, it's not mapped to any action. So the verb would not be converted, but the problem is that in the example, \"jump\" maps to I_JUMP. So the verb must be a primitive verb. Therefore, \"look\" isn't a valid verb, which suggests that the input might be invalid, but since the problem gives this input, maybe we proceed regardless. Or perhaps \"look\" here is a typo and the intended verb is \"walk\" or another. But I can't assume that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the verb and only process the turning. But that's not according to the rules. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is treated as a direction. No, directions are left/right. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a typo and the correct verb is \"walk\", but since we can't confirm, perhaps proceed with the assumption that \"look\" is a valid verb. But according to the rules, it's not. Hmm.\n\nThis seems like a problem. But given that the input is given, perhaps proceed with the idea that \"look\" is a verb, even if it's not listed. But according to the rules, the output should be sequences of uppercase actions. So \"look\" would map to I_LOOK, but that's not in the rules. But the rules state that only the listed primitive verbs are mapped. Therefore, \"look\" is not a primitive verb, so it's not converted. But how to handle that. The problem might have a mistake here, but since I have to process it, maybe the \"look around left twice\" is parsed as follows:\n\n\"look around left\" is \"around left\" which would be [turn left + verb], but the verb \"look\" is invalid, so the verb part is omitted. Then each around left would have four repetitions of [turn left] without the verb. Then \"around left twice\" would be that repeated twice. Wait, but the rule says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So if the verb is invalid, but the structure remains, then each around left would add four turn lefts, and four verbs (but the verb is invalid, so they are skipped). So \"look around left\" would be four times [turn left], and then \"around left twice\" would be twice that. But then, how to proceed. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is ignored, and the command is \"around left twice\", but no. The input is \"look around left twice\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"look\" is a mistake and the correct verb is \"walk\", so the intended parsing would be \"walk around left twice\". But that's assuming. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to test the parsing even with invalid commands, but according to the rules. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look around left\" is treated as \"around left\" with the verb \"look\", which isn't a primitive verb. Then, according to the rules, \"around left\" requires four repetitions of [turn left + verb]. But if \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, then the verb part would have no action.

The input is \"walk right thrice and jump opposite left twice\". I need to break this down into the correct sequence of actions based on the given rules.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the first part: \"walk right thrice\". Wait, the \"walk\" is the verb, and \"right\" here might be a direction. But according to the rules, primitive verbs map to actions. The \"walk\" maps to I_WALK. But \"right\" in this context might be part of the direction. Wait, but looking at the example, like \"jump around right\" resulted in turning right each time before jumping. Hmm. Wait, in the example \"jump around right\", the \"around right\" means turn right each time before jumping. So \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. But here, \"walk right thrice\" might mean walking to the right? Wait, but according to the rules, directions might be part of the verb phrases. Wait, but the rules don't mention directions modifying verbs directly. Let me check the rules again.\n\nRule 1 says primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right are all primitives. Wait, \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are verbs themselves. So \"walk right\" might be parsed as \"walk\" and then \"right\", but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe \"walk right\" is a command to walk towards the right direction. But according to the rules, how are directions handled?\n\nWait, looking at the example: \"jump around right\" becomes I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times. So \"around right\" is a phrase where \"right\" is a direction. Similarly, \"opposite left\" in the current input. The rules mention \"opposite <DIR>\" and \"around <DIR>\", so directions are used in those constructs. So the directions here are left and right.\n\nSo in the current input, \"walk right thrice\" might be interpreted as \"walk\" to the right, but according to the rules, how? Wait, maybe \"walk right\" isn't a primitive. Wait, the primitive verbs are listed. Walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"walk\" is a verb, \"turn right\" is a verb. So \"walk right\" isn't a primitive. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake, but in the input, we have \"walk right thrice and jump opposite left twice\". How to parse this?\n\nWait, maybe \"walk right\" is a command to walk to the right. But according to the given rules, how is direction handled? The rules mention \"opposite <DIR>\" and \"around <DIR>\", but for the basic verbs like walk, run, etc., do they have direction? For example, in the rules, the primitive verbs are \"walk\", \"run\", \"jump\", \"turn left\", \"turn right\". So \"walk\" is a verb that just moves forward, and if you want to turn, you need to explicitly say \"turn left\" or \"turn right\". Therefore, \"walk right\" may not be a primitive verb. So perhaps the input has a mistake, or perhaps I need to interpret \"walk right\" as \"walk to the right\", but according to the rules, how?\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended \"walk right\" to mean turning right first and then walking. But according to the problem's rules, unless specified as part of the primitive verbs, that's not the case. Wait, the problem says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\". The primitive verbs are listed as walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"walk\" is a verb, \"turn right\" is another verb. So \"walk right\" is not a primitive verb. So perhaps the input is \"walk right\" as in walking towards the right direction. But according to the rules, how is that handled?\n\nHmm, maybe the input \"walk right thrice\" should be considered as \"walk\" followed by \"right\", but \"right\" isn't a verb. Alternatively, perhaps \"right\" here is a direction modifier for the walk. But the problem's rules don't specify that. Wait, perhaps the original command is \"walk right\" meaning walk in the right direction, which would imply turning right first? But according to the rules, unless specified, there's no way to handle that. Alternatively, maybe the user intended \"walk right\" to be a sequence of actions. Wait, maybe the input is structured as \"walk right\" where \"right\" is a direction modifier for the walk verb, but according to the rules, this is not defined. The problem's example only uses \"around right\" and \"opposite left\". So perhaps the input is \"walk\" followed by \"right\", which would be invalid. But given that the input is given as \"walk right thrice and jump opposite left twice\", maybe the \"right\" here is part of a different construct.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the \"walk right\" is equivalent to \"walk\" thrice, and \"right\" is a typo. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps \"walk right\" is a shorthand for \"turn right then walk\", but according to the rules, how would that be handled?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"right\" in \"walk right\" is a mistake, and the intended meaning is to walk, then turn right thrice. But the problem is given as-is, so I have to parse it.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"walk right thrice\" is a command to walk to the right three times. But according to the given rules, how do you handle direction for movement? Since the only movement primitives are walk, run, jump, which might be considered forward, unless modified by a turn. So perhaps \"walk right\" is not a primitive, and the input is supposed to be parsed as \"walk\" thrice, but the user added \"right\" by mistake. However, given that the second part of the command is \"jump opposite left twice\", which uses the \"opposite left\" construct, which is a valid rule, perhaps the first part's \"right\" is a direction in some construct.\n\nWait, wait. Let me re-examine the input: \"walk right thrice and jump opposite left twice\". The \"and\" means do the first part then the second. So the first part is \"walk right thrice\", the second part is \"jump opposite left twice\".\n\nBreaking down \"walk right thrice\": Hmm. The problem is that \"walk right\" isn't a primitive verb. So maybe \"walk\" is the verb, and \"right\" is a noun here, which is not possible. Alternatively, maybe the user intended \"walk right\" as \"turn right and walk\", but according to the rules, unless there's a rule that specifies that \"walk <DIR>\" implies turn DIR then walk, that's not covered. However, looking at the example for \"around right\", which involves turning right then jumping. So perhaps \"walk right\" is not a standard command. Alternatively, perhaps the input is structured as \"walk\" followed by \"right thrice\", but that doesn't parse.\n\nWait, perhaps \"walk right\" is a mistake and should be \"turn right\". But assuming the input is correct, I need to parse \"walk right thrice\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"right\" here refers to the direction of the walk, which would require the agent to be facing right before walking. So to walk right, you first turn right, then walk. But how does that fit with the \"thrice\"? Let's think: If \"walk right thrice\" is interpreted as \"walk three times towards the right direction\", then you would first turn right, then walk thrice. But that's not exactly matching the rules. Alternatively, \"walk right\" could be a command that uses the \"around\" or \"opposite\" constructs, but no. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the \"right\" in \"walk right thrice\" is a typo, and the intended phrase was \"walk thrice right\", which could be parsed as \"walk thrice\" followed by \"right\", but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the input should be parsed as \"walk\" and \"right thrice\", but that seems unclear.\n\nThis is a problem because the given input seems to have a structure not directly covered by the rules. Wait, but the example uses \"around right\" as a verb phrase. So the structure is verb followed by a modifier (like around, opposite). So \"walk right\" might not be a standard, but perhaps \"right\" here is part of the verb modifier. Wait, but \"right\" alone isn't a modifier. The modifiers are \"around <DIR>\", \"opposite <DIR>\".\n\nWait, perhaps \"walk right thrice\" is parsed as \"walk\" thrice, and \"right\" is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended \"turn right\" thrice. But given the input, I need to work with it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"walk right\" is a misstatement, and the intended command is \"turn right and walk\", but that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe \"walk right\" is a command that is equivalent to \"walk\" and \"right\", but since \"right\" isn't a verb, that's not possible. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is structured so that \"walk right\" is a mistake, and the correct parsing is (walk) right thrice, but according to the rules, \"right\" as a direction in a verb modifier. Let's re-examine the rules:\n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"opposite left\" would be two turns left, then the verb.\n\nRule 3: \"", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The interpretation of 'walk right thrice' as three consecutive walks is reasonable because 'right' in this context does not combine with 'walk' into a compound action like 'turn right' would.

The input is \"jump around right after walk opposite right twice\". Hmm, first, I need to parse the structure. According to the rules, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So here, \"jump around right\" is A, and \"walk opposite right twice\" is B. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure is \"jump around right after walk opposite right twice\". So the entire command is structured as (jump around right) after (walk opposite right twice). Which means we need to execute the B part first (walk opposite right twice), then do A (jump around right).\n\nLet's parse each part separately. Let's start with \"walk opposite right twice\". Breaking that down: \"opposite right\" means two turns in the right direction. Wait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no. Wait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, wait: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, so \"opposite right\" would be two turns right, then the verb. Wait, but in the example, \"opposite left\" would be two left turns then the verb.\n\nWait, but the user's command is \"walk opposite right twice\". So the verb here is walk. So \"walk opposite right twice\" would be the structure of \"verb opposite DIR multiply\". Let me parse this.\n\nWait, \"opposite right\" is a direction modifier for the verb walk. So according to rule 2, \"opposite right\" means two turns right, then walk. Then \"twice\" applies to the entire verb sequence. Wait, but the structure is \"walk opposite right twice\". So the \"twice\" applies to the entire walk opposite right. Hmm, rule 4 says \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So in this case, the entire action of \"walk opposite right\" is to be done twice.\n\nWait, but \"walk opposite right\" is itself a verb plus direction modifier. So breaking down \"walk opposite right twice\", first, the \"opposite right\" part applies to the walk. Then the \"twice\" applies to the entire walk opposite right sequence.\n\nSo first, \"walk opposite right\" would be two turns right (since opposite right is two turns right, then the verb walk). So walk opposite right becomes: I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT, I_WALK. Then \"twice\" would mean doing that entire sequence twice. So that part would be: [I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK] repeated twice. Which would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK.\n\nWait, but wait, \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. The verb sequence here is \"walk opposite right\". So the \"twice\" would mean that the entire \"walk opposite right\" is done twice. Which would mean each time, two right turns and then walk, and that whole thing twice. So yes, the sequence would be each of the two right turns plus walk, then again two right turns plus walk.\n\nNow moving on to the other part: \"jump around right\". Rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" equals 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"jump around right\" would be four times: turn right then jump. So each cycle is turn right, jump, repeated four times. So the sequence would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP four times. Which would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP.\n\nBut wait, the original command is \"jump around right after walk opposite right twice\". Which according to rule 6, \"A after B\" means B then A. So the entire sequence is first do B, which is \"walk opposite right twice\", then do A, which is \"jump around right\".\n\nPutting it all together: first the walk part, then the jump around.\n\nSo the full sequence would be:\n\nFirst B: walk opposite right twice → [I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK] repeated twice.\n\nSo that's:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK.\n\nThen A: jump around right → four times [turn right + jump]\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP.\n\nThen, wait, according to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is turn DIR then verb. So for \"jump around right\", each of the four repetitions is I_TURN_RIGHT then I_JUMP. So four times two actions each. So total 8 actions. Then, the jump around would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times, each preceded by a turn right? Wait, no. Wait, each repetition is [turn DIR + verb], so each of the four steps is turn right and then jump. So four times:\n\nTurn right, jump; turn right, jump; turn right, jump; turn right, jump.\n\nWhich would result in:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP.\n\nWait, but in the example given, \"jump around right\" outputs four turns right and four jumps. Wait the example output was:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nWait, wait, the example output shows three jumps and four turns? Wait no:\n\nIn the example, the output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nBreaking that down: four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP? Because each of the first three turns is followed by a jump, then a final turn. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the example input is \"jump around right\", which according to rule 3 should be four repetitions of [turn right + jump]. Each repetition is two actions, so four repetitions would be 4 * 2 = 8 actions. But in the example output, there are 4 I_TURN_RIGHT and 3 I_JUMP? Because:\n\nLet me count:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP → first repetition\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP → second\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP → third\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT → fourth repetition, only the turn?\n\nWait that doesn't fit. The example output in the problem statement says:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT ?\n\nWait no, the example given in the problem says:\n\nExample:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, the output has four I_TURN_RIGHT and three I_JUMP?\n\nWait, in the example's output, split into tokens:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nThat's four turn rights and three jumps. That's seven tokens. Hmm, but according to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition has two actions. So four repetitions would be 8 actions.\n\nWait, this discrepancy is a problem. The example output must have a typo perhaps? Let me check.\n\nOriginal example:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, between the tokens, there are three jumps and four turns. Which would be four turns and three jumps. That's 7 tokens. But according to rule 3, four repetitions of two actions would be 8 actions. So the example output seems to be missing a jump. Or perhaps the example is a mistake.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the example is written with a space between each, and perhaps the user made a mistake. Let's re-examine the example:\n\nThe example says:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP  I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSo the output has three I_JUMP and four I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nHmm. So how many repetitions? The output would be:\n\nEach repetition is [turn, jump], so three repetitions would give three jumps and three turns, then the fourth repetition would be a turn without the jump. That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule was misread. Let me check the rules again.\n\nRule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb].\n\nAh, so each repetition is turn DIR, then verb. So four times two actions. So total of 8 actions, four turns and four verbs. So in the example, the output should be four I_TURN_RIGHT and four I_JUMP. But the example's output has three I_JUMP and four I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nWait, in the example:\n\nThe output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nBreaking that down:\n\n1. Turn right, jump\n\n2. Turn right, jump\n\n3. Turn right, jump\n\n4. Turn right\n\nSo three full repetitions (each two actions), then a single turn. Which contradicts the rule. Therefore, perhaps the example is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the \"around\" requires four turns, each followed by the verb, and then the fourth verb comes after the fourth turn. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the example is correct. Wait, but according to the rule, \"around <DIR>\" equals four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is turn DIR, then verb. So four times. So each repetition:\n\n1", "rationality_label": "Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The original command 'jump around right after walk opposite right twice' must be parsed by breaking it into its components according to the given rules.

But perhaps in this context, \"look\" is considered a verb that maps to an action, maybe I_LOOK. But the rules don't specify that. Hmm.\n\nWait, the example input uses \"jump around right\", which the output is the appropriate sequence. So perhaps any verb not listed in the primitive verbs would not be processed. However, the current problem's input is \"look opposite left twice after look\". So perhaps the user expects that \"look\" is a verb, even if it's not a primitive one. But according to the problem's rules, we should only process the given commands. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the input, but as per the problem's instructions, we need to process it as per the rules. Maybe \"look\" is a verb that's treated as a primitive verb, so it would map to I_LOOK. The problem doesn't state that other verbs can't exist, but the rules are given for the specified verbs. Wait, the first rule says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions: walk→I_WALK, etc. So other verbs (like look) may also be primitive, but not listed, but the user hasn't provided their mappings. But in the example, they have \"jump\", which is mapped. So perhaps in this case, \"look\" is not a primitive verb. But how to handle it? The problem says to process the command, so perhaps we have to proceed assuming that \"look\" is a primitive verb with action I_LOOK.\n\nBut the rules only specify the uppercase actions for certain verbs. So maybe the system has a predefined list, but in this problem, we have to follow the rules. Wait, but the problem says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\" and lists walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" is not a primitive verb here. Therefore, how to handle this?\n\nWait, perhaps \"look\" is a verb that's not part of the primitive verbs, so the system would not process it, but the command is given, so perhaps the intended answer is to ignore the verb if it's not in the primitive list. But that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and \"look\" should be \"walk\", or another valid verb. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is intended to be treated as a verb, and the system has other actions. Since the example uses \"jump\", which is in the list, but the problem here uses \"look\", but the user wants us to output the correct sequence, even if \"look\" is not in the original list. Maybe \"look\" is a typo, but since we need to process it, perhaps we should treat it as a verb. Let's proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a valid verb that maps to I_LOOK. Otherwise, the problem wouldn't ask to process this command.\n\nSo moving forward:\n\nThe input is \"look opposite left twice after look\".\n\nBreaking it into parts: \"A after B\" → do B then A.\n\nSo B is \"look\", and A is \"look opposite left twice\".\n\nTherefore, first perform \"look\", then perform \"look opposite left twice\".\n\nNow, processing \"look opposite left twice\".\n\nThis has \"opposite left\" as per rule 2: two turns in left direction, then the verb. The verb here is \"look\". Then \"twice\" means repeat the entire sequence twice. Wait, rule 4 says \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. Wait, rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" is repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, but \"opposite left twice\" is part of the structure. Wait, in \"look opposite left twice\", the structure is \"look opposite left\" modified by \"twice\". Let's parse it again.\n\nThe command \"look opposite left twice\" can be broken down as \"look opposite left\" with \"twice\" applied. So according to rule 2: \"opposite left\" means two left turns, then the verb. Then \"twice\" means repeat that entire sequence twice.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the \"twice\" applies to the verb. Rule 4 says: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"look opposite left twice\" would be the verb \"look opposite left\", which itself includes a rule 2 transformation, then \"twice\" would repeat that verb sequence twice.\n\nWait, but how exactly? Let's parse \"look opposite left twice\". According to rule 4, the \"twice\" applies to the verb. So \"look... twice\" → repeat the verb part twice. So the verb here is \"look opposite left twice\". Or is \"look opposite left\" the verb, then \"twice\" repeats it.\n\nWait, rule 4 says: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So the entire verb sequence (the verb and its modifiers) is done twice. So \"look opposite left\" is the verb (with \"opposite left\" modifying it), then \"twice\" → repeat that entire action twice.\n\nWait, but \"opposite left\" is a modified verb. Let's take an example. For example, \"walk opposite right twice\" would be:\n\nFirst, \"opposite right\" → two right turns, then walk. Then \"twice\" → repeat that entire sequence (two right turns, walk) twice.\n\nWait, but rule 4 says \"repeat the verb sequence twice\". So \"verb twice\" would be the transformed verb (including its own rules) done twice. So in the case of \"look opposite left twice\", the entire action of \"look opposite left\" (which is two left turns then look, per rule 2) is repeated twice.\n\nWait, but rule 2 says that \"opposite <DIR>\" becomes two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"look opposite left\" would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK\n\nBut then \"twice\" would repeat that entire sequence twice. So:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK\n\nWait, because each \"look opposite left\" is two left turns plus look, and doing that twice would be doubling that.\n\nBut now, in the original problem statement, the command is \"look opposite left twice after look\", which we have to parse as:\n\nFirst do \"look\", then do \"look opposite left twice\".\n\nSo the entire sequence would be:\n\nFirst, \"look\" → I_LOOK\n\nThen, \"look opposite left twice\" → two left turns plus look, repeated twice. So each \"look opposite left\" is two left turns, then look. But since \"twice\" applies to that entire verb, the sequence would be:\n\nFor each repetition:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK\n\nRepeated twice.

The user wants me to parse \"jump around left thrice after turn opposite right thrice\". Hmm, I need to break this down into parts using the rules provided.\n\nFirst, let's split the command into two main parts based on \"after\". According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So here, A is \"jump around left thrice\" and B is \"turn opposite right thrice\". So the order should be B first, then A.\n\nLet's parse B first: \"turn opposite right thrice\". The word \"opposite right\" refers to rule 2. Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, \"opposite right\" would mean two turns right, then the verb. But the verb here is \"turn\", so \"turn opposite right\" would be turning right twice. Wait, wait. Let me recheck. Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the wording: \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, for example, if the direction is left, then opposite left would be two turns left. But the verb would be the original action. Wait, in the example given, \"jump around right\" becomes four times [turn right + jump], which is from rule 3. \n\nWait, rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So for example, if the original action was \"turn left\", then \"opposite left\" would be two turns left followed by the verb. Wait, maybe \"opposite <DIR>\" is a direction modifier. Let me think again. Let's take an example. Suppose the command was \"walk opposite right\". Then according to rule 2, this would be two turns right (since opposite direction) then walk. Wait, no. Wait, the rule says that \"opposite <DIR>\" is equivalent to two turns in DIR, then the verb. Wait, no. Wait, the rule says \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, the verb is the original action. So for example, \"walk opposite left\" would mean: turn left twice, then walk. Because the opposite direction would be achieved by two turns left (each turn left 90 degrees, so two would be 180 degrees). So \"turn opposite right\" would be two turns right, then the verb. Wait, but the verb here is \"turn\". Hmm, no. Wait, in the command \"turn opposite right\", how does it parse?\n\nWait, the command is \"turn opposite right thrice\". Let's parse \"turn opposite right\". The phrase \"opposite right\" is a direction modifier. So according to rule 2, \"opposite right\" means two turns in right direction. Then the verb is \"turn\". Wait, but that's confusing. Wait, maybe the entire action is \"turn opposite right\", which would be parsed as two turns right, then the verb. Wait, the verb here is \"turn\", so \"turn opposite right\" would be \"turn\" in the opposite direction of right. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's re-express.\n\nThe structure of the B part is \"turn opposite right thrice\". So \"turn opposite right\" is the verb and direction, and \"thrice\" applies to that. So first, \"turn opposite right\" is the verb, then multiplied by thrice. But according to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" is equivalent to two turns in DIR followed by the verb. Wait, so \"turn opposite right\" would be parsed as two turns right, then the verb. But the verb here is \"turn\". Wait, but turning again? Hmm. Let's take this step by step.\n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So if the original command is \"walk opposite left\", it's equivalent to \"I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK\". So \"opposite left\" translates to two left turns followed by the verb. Therefore, \"turn opposite right\" would be \"turn\" in the opposite direction of right. Wait, but \"turn\" is the action. So \"turn opposite right\" would be two turns right, then the verb, which is \"turn\". Wait, but that would be \"I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_?\" Wait, this is confusing. Because the original verb is \"turn\", but the direction of the turn is modified.\n\nWait, perhaps \"turn opposite right\" is a command that needs to be broken down. The verb is \"turn\", and the direction is \"opposite right\". So according to rule 2, \"opposite right\" means two right turns, then the verb. But how does that work? If the direction is modified, then the turn action would be in the opposite direction. So perhaps \"turn opposite right\" is equivalent to two right turns followed by a turn in the original direction? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"opposite\" here refers to the direction of the turn. So \"turn opposite right\" would be a left turn. Because the opposite of right is left. Wait, but according to the rules given, we have to follow the specific rules. Rule 2 states that \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. So regardless of what the verb is, \"opposite\" in the direction would expand to two turns in that direction followed by the verb.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is that if you have a verb followed by a direction, and that direction is \"opposite <DIR>\", then you replace that with two turns in DIR and then do the verb. So for example, if the command is \"walk opposite left\", it's two left turns then walk.\n\nSo in the case of \"turn opposite right\", it would be two right turns, then the verb \"turn\". But the verb here is \"turn\" but without a direction. Hmm. Wait, the original command is \"turn opposite right\". So the direction of the turn is opposite right. Which per rule 2 would be two turns right, then the verb. But the verb is \"turn\" here, which would need a direction. Wait, this seems conflicting. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, the original command is \"turn opposite right thrice\". Let's look at the entire phrase. The verb is \"turn\", direction is \"opposite right\", and thrice. But according to the rules, \"turn left\" maps to I_TURN_LEFT. So \"turn opposite right\" must be a direction modifier. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"opposite right\" is a direction. So \"turn opposite right\" would be equivalent to turning left, but according to rule 2, it's two turns right, then the verb. Wait, but the verb is the action. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the command \"turn opposite right\" is not a primitive verb. The primitive verbs are turn left and turn right. So how to handle \"turn opposite right\"? According to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" expands to two turns in DIR then the verb. So if the original command is \"jump opposite left\", then it would be two left turns followed by a jump. But in this case, the command is \"turn opposite right\", so the verb is \"turn\", but directions for turn are left/right. So expanding \"turn opposite right\" would be two right turns, followed by a turn. Wait, but a turn in which direction? Because the original verb is \"turn\", but the direction is implied. Wait, perhaps the \"turn\" in \"turn opposite right\" is the verb, and the direction is \"opposite right\", which per rule 2 would expand to two turns right, then the verb. But the verb is turn, but which direction?\n\nThis seems ambiguous. Maybe there's an error in my approach here. Let's try to think again.\n\nThe problem is the phrase \"turn opposite right thrice\". Let's parse this. The base is \"turn opposite right\", modified by \"thrice\". According to rule 2, \"opposite right\" would mean that the direction is opposite, so the command \"turn opposite right\" would expand to two turns right (since the opposite direction of a turn is obtained by turning twice), followed by the verb. But the verb here is \"turn\", which needs a direction. Hmm. Maybe the \"turn\" here is a turn in the original direction, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"turn opposite right\" is equivalent to turning in the opposite direction of right, which is left. So \"turn opposite right\" would be \"I_TURN_LEFT\". But according to rule 2, the expansion should be two turns in DIR (right) then the verb. Wait, but the problem is that the verb's direction is modified. Let me recheck the exact wording of rule 2:\n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb.\n\nWait, this might mean that \"opposite <DIR>\" is a way to indicate that the direction of the verb is opposite, which would be equivalent to doing two turns in DIR, then performing the verb. Wait, but the verb could be any primitive verb.\n\nFor example, \"walk opposite left\" would be two left turns, then walk. Which would face the opposite direction of left (since two left turns would turn 180 degrees, so opposite direction of left would be right? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, each left turn is 90 degrees left. Two left turns would be 180 degrees, so opposite direction.

Oh, the rules mention that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. The given verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" isn't one of them. But maybe \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are the only turn commands. Wait, the user might have made a mistake, but according to the rules, \"look\" isn't a valid primitive verb.

Therefore, the input \"look twice\" might be an invalid command. But maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is supposed to be a different action.

But perhaps the user intended a different verb. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" here is a typo. But since I have to process this as per the given rules, perhaps the correct approach is to ignore it or assume there's a typo. Wait, but that's not possible. Maybe the user meant \"turn left\" or \"turn right\"? But the input is \"look twice and run left\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"jump left\" or something else. But given that \"run left\" is part of the command, perhaps \"look\" is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a placeholder for a different action. Hmm, this is confusing. Let's check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the problem states that the agent should process navigation commands following the given rules. The primitive verbs are strictly walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, the input \"look twice\" would not be a valid command. However, in the context of the problem, perhaps the user intended \"look\" to be a verb, but according to the rules, it's not. So how to proceed?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo and the correct command is \"walk twice and run left\". But the input is as given. Since the problem says to process the command according to the rules, and \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, perhaps there's an error. However, the problem might expect me to proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a valid action. Wait, but the problem didn't mention handling invalid commands. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the input, or maybe \"look\" is a typo. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is supposed to be a different verb, like \"jump\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended \"look\" as a direction, but \"look\" is a verb. Wait, perhaps \"look\" here is a mistake, and the correct verb is \"jump\" or another primitive verb. But given that the input is fixed, I have to work with it.\n\nAssuming that \"look\" is a typo and the intended verb is \"turn left\", but that's speculative. Alternatively, maybe the user intended \"look\" to be a no-op, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\". But without knowing, this is unclear. However, the problem requires processing the command. Since the example uses \"jump around right\", which maps to turning right and jumping each time, maybe the agent is supposed to ignore invalid verbs. But that's not specified in the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a mistake and the user meant \"walk\" or another verb. But how can I proceed?\n\nWait, maybe \"look\" here is a typo for \"turn left\". Let's say \"look\" is \"turn left\". Then \"look twice\" would be \"turn left twice\". But this is a guess. However, given that the problem requires processing the command as given, but according to the rules, \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, so this command is invalid. But the problem might expect the assistant to process it somehow. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, but since I need to provide an answer, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that \"look\" is a typo for another verb. But this is risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is part of a compound phrase. For example, \"look around\" or something else, but in the input it's \"look twice\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\", and proceed with that. But this is a big assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"look\" is a typo for \"turn left\", given that \"run left\" is in the command. But again, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\", so \"walk twice\" would be \"I_WALK I_WALK\". Then \"and run left\" would be \"run left\", which is \"I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT\".\n\nBut without knowing the intended action, this is difficult. However, given the problem's example, maybe the correct approach is to ignore the invalid verb and proceed, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that \"look twice\" is a typo for \"jump twice\", and the answer is based on that. But again, this is a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and \"look\" should be \"turn left\", but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look twice\" is a red herring, and the correct action is to output nothing for invalid commands. But the problem states to output the sequence of actions, so maybe the user intended that \"look\" is a valid verb. Perhaps the problem's initial list was incomplete. Wait, checking the problem statement again:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nPrimitive verbs map to uppercase actions:\nwalk→I_WALK, run→I_RUN, jump→I_JUMP, turn left→I_TURN_LEFT, turn right→I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nSo only those five. So \"look\" is not a primitive verb. Therefore, the command \"look twice\" is invalid, but the problem expects me to process this. However, since the example input includes \"jump around right\" which is processed, perhaps the problem expects that the input is valid according to the rules. Therefore, the current input \"look twice and run left\" contains an invalid primitive verb.\n\nBut the problem might have a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a single verb. According to the rules, \"run\" is a verb, but \"left\" would be part of a turn command. Wait, the primitive verbs include \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". So \"run left\" is not a primitive verb. The input is \"run left\", which is a direction. But according to the rules, how to handle that?\n\nWait, the command \"run left\" might be interpreted as \"run\" followed by \"turn left\". Or is \"run left\" a separate command? According to the rules, \"turn left\" is a primitive verb. But \"run left\" isn't listed. Therefore, perhaps \"run left\" is a mistake. But according to the example, \"jump around right\" is processed into a sequence. So maybe \"run left\" should be parsed as \"run\" followed by \"turn left\"? Or is \"run left\" equivalent to \"turn left\" then \"run\"? Or maybe \"run left\" is a direction to run in the left direction, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are fixed.\n\nThis is a problem. Let's re-express the input: \"look twice and run left\".\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nFirst part: \"look twice\" — since \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, this is invalid. Second part: \"run left\" — \"run\" is a primitive verb. \"left\" could be part of a turn command, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a misphrase, and the correct interpretation is \"turn left then run\". But according to the given rules, how would that work? The rules don't mention handling direction after verbs. For example, \"run to the left\" might be different, but according to the current rules, \"run\" is just I_RUN. So unless there's a compound verb like \"turn left\", \"run left\" is not a primitive verb. Therefore, \"run left\" would be invalid.\n\nThis suggests that the entire command may be invalid. However, given that the example input includes \"jump around right\" and the user expects an output, I must assume that the input here is valid and there's a misunderstanding in parsing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"run left\" is equivalent to \"turn left\" (if the intended meaning is to face left and then run, but according to the rules, that would be two separate actions: I_TURN_LEFT followed by I_RUN.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run left\" is a way to say \"run\" while facing left, but according to the problem's rules, the direction might require using", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 40, "model_reflection": "The initial response assumed that 'look' was a typo for 'walk', which is speculative and not supported by the rules provided.

The input is \"look around left thrice after jump around right twice\". First, I need to parse each part according to the rules provided.\n\nStarting with \"jump around right twice\". According to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" means 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb is \"jump\" and the direction is \"right\". So for \"jump around right\", it should be turning right then jump four times. But since there's a \"twice\" modifier, that entire sequence is repeated twice. So that part becomes: [I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP] repeated four times, then the whole thing again twice. Wait, no. Wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 reps of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"jump around right\" would be turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump. Then \"twice\" would repeat that entire sequence again. So that part would be (I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP) repeated twice. Wait, no. Wait, \"jump around right\" is one around command. So around right is four times [turn right + jump]. So each around right is four steps. Then \"twice\" would mean repeat that around right twice. So the entire around right sequence is done twice. So the first part is jump around right twice, which becomes:\n\nFor each around right:\nturn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump.\n\nThen twice would make that sequence happen two times. So each around right done twice. Wait, but the \"around\" already includes four steps. So \"jump around right\" is four steps. Then \"twice\" would make that entire four-step sequence happen twice. So each \"jump around right\" is four steps, and twice would make it eight steps. Wait, no, wait: \"around\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"jump around right\" is [turn right + jump] *4. Then \"twice\" would mean do that entire sequence twice. So each \"jump around right\" is four steps, so twice would be 4*2=8 steps. So the first part (jump around right twice) becomes:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times, then that whole thing again once more. Wait, but each around is four times. So:\n\nFirst around right twice: each around is four steps, so two times around would be 8 steps. So each around right twice would be turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, then again turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump. Wait, no, no. Wait, \"jump around right twice\" is \"jump around right\" done twice. So each time, it's four [turn right + jump], then another four. So total of eight steps. So:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (first around right)\nthen again the same four steps again (twice). So total eight steps. So that's the first part.\n\nNow the second part: \"look around left thrice after ...\". Wait, the structure is \"A after B\", which according to rule 6 means do B then A. So the entire command is \"look around left thrice\" (which is A) after \"jump around right twice\" (B), so first do B (jump around right twice), then do A (look around left thrice).\n\nWait, the input is \"look around left thrice after jump around right twice\". So according to rule 6, \"A after B\" is B then A. So first do the jump around right twice, then the look around left thrice.\n\nNow, \"look around left thrice\". \"around left\" is four repetitions of [turn left + look]. But there's no primitive verb for look. Wait, the rules say primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. The given verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" is not listed. Hmm. Wait, the problem says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\". The example uses \"jump around right\", which maps to I_JUMP, so the primitive verbs are verbs like walk, run, jump. The user's input has \"look around left\", so \"look\" must be considered a primitive verb here. But according to the initial rules, the example only shows those five verbs. Wait, maybe the user expects that \"look\" is a valid primitive verb here. Because otherwise, the instruction can't be processed. So perhaps the mapping includes other verbs, and the initial list in the rules is not exhaustive? Or perhaps the user made a mistake. But given that the input includes \"look\", I have to assume that \"look\" is a primitive verb that maps to an action like I_LOOK. Otherwise, the problem can't be solved. But since the rules don't mention look, but the example uses \"jump\", which is in the list, maybe the user intended that \"look\" is also a valid verb. So perhaps the correct mapping here is \"look\" → I_LOOK.\n\nSo proceeding under that assumption.\n\nSo \"look around left\" would be four times [turn left + look], so four times I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK.\n\nThen \"thrice\" would mean repeating that entire around left sequence three times. Each around left is four steps, so three times around left would be 4*3=12 steps.\n\nPutting it all together: the entire command is first process \"jump around right twice\" (which is 8 steps), then process \"look around left thrice\" (12 steps). So the total sequence would be:\n\nJump around right twice:\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (first around right)\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (twice)\n\nThen look around left thrice:\nEach around left is four times I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK, repeated thrice.\n\nSo first around left:\nI_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK\n\nSecond around left:\nSame as above again.\n\nThird around left:\nSame again.\n\nSo combining all, the entire action sequence would be:\n\n[Jump around right twice (8 steps)] [look around left thrice (12 steps)]\n\nSo the final output would be all those actions in order, separated by spaces.\n", "rationality_label": "Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 40, "model_reflection": "The original response misinterprets the command structure, particularly the interaction of 'around' with repetition modifiers like 'thrice' and the overall ordering implied by 'after'.

The input is \"run around left twice after jump opposite right twice\". Hmm, the rules are a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's split the command into parts. The main structure here is \"A after B\", which according to rule 6 means we do B first, then A. So \"A after B\" becomes B then A. In this case, A is \"run around left twice\" and B is \"jump opposite right twice\". So we need to process B first, then A.\n\nLet's start with B: \"jump opposite right twice\". Breaking this down. The word \"opposite right\" refers to rule 2. Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR direction then the verb. So \"opposite right\" would be two turns right, then jump. Wait, wait. Wait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no. Wait: \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, no, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me check again. Rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, does that mean two turns in the DIR direction? Like \"opposite right\" would be two right turns, then the verb. Because opposite direction of right is left, but according to the rule, it's two turns in DIR. Wait, perhaps the rule is that \"opposite right\" means two turns right, which would result in facing the opposite direction, which would be 180 degrees. Hmm. But regardless, according to the rule, \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. So regardless of the direction, if you have \"opposite right\", you do two right turns and then the verb. Wait, but the verb here is \"jump\". So \"jump opposite right\" would be two turns right, then jump. Wait, no. Wait, the structure here is \"verb opposite DIR\". So in the example \"jump opposite right twice\", which is part of the input here.\n\nWait, the part B is \"jump opposite right twice\". Let's parse that. Let's look at \"jump opposite right\" first. The \"opposite right\" here would be a direction modifier. Wait, the rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, but how does that fit into the command? Let's re-examine rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So if the command is \"opposite <DIR> <verb>\", then the verb is preceded by two turns in DIR. But in the example given, like \"jump around right\", the rule 3 applies. So in this case, the input \"jump opposite right\" would be parsed as two turns right (since opposite right?), then jump. Wait, but the rule says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, perhaps the \"opposite\" part is equivalent to two turns in the DIR direction, followed by the verb. So \"jump opposite right\" would be two right turns followed by jump. Or is the verb part of the opposite? Hmm.\n\nWait, the rule 2 says: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, that wording is confusing. Wait, maybe \"opposite <DIR>\" is a phrase, and the verb that follows is the one that's modified. For example, if you have \"walk opposite left\", then the entire phrase would be two left turns, then walk. Because \"opposite left\" would mean two left turns. Hmm. So the structure is that when you have a verb followed by \"opposite DIR\", you replace that with two turns in DIR direction followed by the verb. So in \"jump opposite right\", the \"opposite right\" applies to the jump, so we do two right turns, then jump. Wait, but then the jump would be in the new direction. But according to the rule, the verb is executed after the two turns. So each occurrence of \"opposite DIR\" in the command would be replaced by two turns in DIR, then the verb.\n\nNow, in the B part: \"jump opposite right twice\". The \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. Rule 4 says \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So first, parse \"jump opposite right\", then repeat that twice. Let's parse \"jump opposite right\" first. As per rule 2, \"opposite right\" would mean two right turns and then the jump. Wait, but wait, the \"opposite right\" is part of the verb phrase. So \"jump opposite right\" would be two right turns, then jump. Then, since it's \"twice\", we repeat that entire sequence twice. So each iteration is two right turns, then jump, and we do that twice. So B becomes: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP.\n\nNow, moving on to A: \"run around left twice\". Rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"run around left\" would be 4 times [turn left + run]. So [I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN] repeated 4 times. Then \"twice\" would mean we repeat that entire sequence twice. Wait, rule 4: \"A twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"run around left twice\" would be (run around left) done twice. So first, parse \"run around left\" as per rule 3, which is four repetitions of [turn left + run], then repeat that entire action sequence twice. Wait, but rule 4 says \"A twice\" means repeat the verb sequence twice. So if A is \"run around left\", then \"A twice\" would be doing run around left two times. Which would be equivalent to 4 repetitions each time, so total 8 times? Wait, let's clarify.\n\n\"run around left\" is 4 repetitions of [turn left + run], which would be [I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN] four times. Then \"twice\" would mean doing that entire sequence two times. So the total for \"run around left twice\" would be [turn left run] four times, then again [turn left run] four times. So total eight turns left and eight runs.\n\nBut wait, the rule says \"A twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So the \"around left\" is a verb sequence. Wait, no. Wait, the \"run around left\" is a verb sequence. So \"run around left\" is equivalent to 4 repetitions of [turn left and run]. Then \"run around left twice\" would be repeating that entire \"run around left\" twice. Which would be 4 * 2 = 8 times the [turn left run]. So the entire action list would be eight times: I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN, repeated eight times? Wait, no, four times each time. So first four times, then another four times. So total eight times.\n\nSo putting it all together, the A part is \"run around left twice\" which is 8 times [turn left run], and the B part is \"jump opposite right twice\" which is two times [two right turns and a jump].\n\nBut according to the structure \"A after B\", we need to do B first, then A. So the final sequence would be B followed by A.\n\nSo B: [I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP] repeated twice. Wait, no. Wait, the B part is \"jump opposite right twice\". Let's re-examine that.\n\nBreaking down \"jump opposite right twice\": \"jump opposite right\" is the verb phrase with \"opposite right\", which according to rule 2 is two right turns then jump. Then \"twice\" means repeat that verb phrase twice. So each time, two right turns and a jump. So two iterations of that. So:\n\nFirst iteration: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nSecond iteration: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nTherefore, the B part is: I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nNow, the A part is \"run around left twice\". \"run around left\" is per rule 3: 4 repetitions of [turn left + run], then \"twice\" means repeat that again. So each \"run around left\" is 4 times [turn left, run], so twice would be 8 times total. Wait, no: \"run around left\" is the 4 repetitions, and \"twice\" would repeat the entire \"run around left\" twice. So two sets of four. So:\n\nFirst set: I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN four times.\n\nSecond set: I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN four times again.\n\nSo total of eight actions (four each, so eight elements), each pair of turn left and run. So A part is:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN (four times), then again I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN (four times again), making eight in total.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the \"run around left\" is four times [turn left, run], so each run around left is four repetitions. So \"run around left\" would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_RUN repeated four times → that's 4 turns left and four runs.\n\nThen \"run around left twice\" would be that same sequence twice. So total of eight actions (each of four", "rationality_label": "Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 65, "model_reflection": "Upon reviewing the initial response, I identified several issues in the parsing of the command.

The input is \"run around left after walk left\". Hmm, according to the rules, I need to parse this into actions. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the phrase \"run around left\". Rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So here, the verb is \"run\" and the direction is left. So each repetition would be I_TURN_LEFT followed by I_RUN. And since it's four times, that's four sets of those two actions. So that part would be (I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN) repeated four times. Wait, but the example for \"jump around right\" gives four turns and four jumps, alternating. So yeah, each repetition is turn then verb. So \"run around left\" would be I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN four times, resulting in eight actions total: four turns and four runs.\n\nBut wait, the example shows that \"jump around right\" gives four turns and four jumps. So each repetition is turn then jump. So four times [turn right + jump], which gives four turns and four jumps. So yes, same structure here. So \"run around left\" would be four times [turn left, run], so four I_TURN_LEFT and four I_RUN in sequence.\n\nNow, the next part is \"walk left\". That's straightforward: I_TURN_LEFT followed by I_WALK. Wait, no. Wait, \"walk left\" is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the original rules say that primitive verbs map to actions. But \"turn left\" maps to I_TURN_LEFT. But \"walk left\" is not a primitive verb. Wait, wait, looking at the rules:\n\nRule 1 says primitive verbs map to actions. The primitives listed are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Wait, so \"turn left\" is a primitive verb, and maps to I_TURN_LEFT, and similarly for turn right. But \"walk left\" is not a primitive verb listed. Wait, wait. Wait, the user input here is \"walk left\", but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are the ones listed. So \"walk\" is a primitive verb, as is \"run\", \"jump\", \"turn left\", \"turn right\". Wait, the first line says:\n\nPrimitive verbs map to uppercase actions: walk→I_WALK, run→I_RUN, jump→I_JUMP, turn left→I_TURN_LEFT, turn right→I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nAh, okay. So \"walk left\" is not a primitive verb. Wait, no. Wait, the primitive verbs are \"walk\", \"run\", \"jump\", \"turn left\", \"turn right\". So \"walk\" is a verb, but \"walk left\" isn't. Wait, perhaps the user input \"walk left\" is a combination of the verb \"walk\" and the direction. Wait, but how to parse that. Wait, in the example given, \"jump around right\" is parsed as four turns right and four jumps. So \"around right\" modifies the verb. But \"walk left\" could be interpreted as \"turn left then walk\". Or perhaps \"walk left\" is not a primitive verb, so we have to parse \"walk\" followed by some direction instruction.\n\nWait, perhaps the input \"walk left\" is a mistake. Or perhaps the user intended to use \"turn left\" as part of the command. Let me check again. The user input is \"run around left after walk left\". So the two components are \"run around left\" and \"walk left\". But according to the rules, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"walk left\" isn't a primitive verb. Hmm. Wait, perhaps \"walk left\" is equivalent to \"turn left then walk\"? No, maybe not. Wait, perhaps \"walk left\" is being used as a verb, but according to the rules, it's not primitive. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but as a semantic parsing agent, I need to parse according to the rules. Wait, perhaps \"walk left\" should be interpreted as \"turn left and then walk\". Because \"turn left\" is a verb, so \"walk left\" might not be a valid primitive. Therefore, perhaps \"walk left\" should be parsed as \"turn left then walk\", but that's not clear. Wait, maybe the original problem has \"walk left\" meaning \"turn left and then walk\". Wait, but according to the rules, how would that work?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user input \"walk left\" is a command that combines two verbs: \"turn left\" and \"walk\". Let's see. The command \"walk left\" could be \"turn left\" and then \"walk\". So according to rule 5: \"A and B\" = do A then B. So \"walk left\" would be equivalent to \"walk and turn left\"? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps \"walk left\" is ambiguous. Wait, but given that \"turn left\" is a primitive verb, and \"walk\" is another, then perhaps \"walk left\" is a mistake. Or perhaps the user input is a combination of \"walk\" and a direction modifier. But according to the rules, how to parse?\n\nWait, perhaps the user input \"walk left\" should be parsed as \"turn left then walk\", but that's not stated in the rules. Alternatively, perhaps \"left\" here refers to the direction for the verb. But according to the rules, the only modifiers are \"opposite\", \"around\", \"twice\", etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is \"walk left\" as in \"turn left\", but using the verb \"walk\". No, but according to the rules, \"turn left\" is a separate verb. So perhaps \"walk left\" is not a valid primitive verb, but a compound command. Wait, maybe \"left\" here is a direction modifier. Let's re-examine the original problem.\n\nThe user input is \"run around left after walk left\". Let's parse each part.\n\nFirst, the \"walk left\" part. If \"left\" is a direction modifier, but the verbs are primitive. So \"walk\" is a verb, and \"left\" could be a direction modifier. But according to the rules, how does direction apply to walk? The modifiers are \"opposite\", \"around\", etc. So perhaps \"walk left\" is equivalent to \"walk after turn left\", but that's not clear.\n\nWait, maybe \"walk left\" is a misstatement, and should be \"turn left\" followed by walk. Or perhaps \"walk to the left\", which would require turning left first and then moving. But according to the rules, how to handle that. Alternatively, perhaps \"walk left\" is a command that requires turning left and then walking. But according to the rules, the user hasn't specified that structure. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"walk left\" is \"walk\" and then \"turn left\", but that would be a different command. But without a connector like \"and\" or \"after\", how do we parse it? Wait, the original problem's example is \"jump around right\" which is parsed into the 4 turns and jumps. So in the user input, \"run around left after walk left\", the \"run around left\" is a verb phrase, and \"walk left\" is another verb phrase.\n\nWait, perhaps \"walk left\" here is \"walk\" followed by \"left\", but \"left\" is a direction modifier. Wait, but according to the rules, only \"opposite\", \"around\", \"twice\", \"thrice\", and \"and\" or \"after\" are the rules. So \"walk left\" is a command that's not using any of the modifiers. But \"left\" here is not a modifier. Therefore, maybe \"walk left\" is invalid, but perhaps the user intended \"walk\" and \"turn left\" as two separate verbs. Wait, but how to parse \"walk left\" without any conjunction. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"walk left\" is a typo and should be \"turn left\". Let's proceed under that assumption. Because otherwise, it's unclear how to parse \"walk left\" with the given rules. So assuming that \"walk left\" is a command to first turn left then walk. But according to the rules, how would that be expressed?\n\nWait, looking at the example again. The example input is \"jump around right\" which maps to four turns right and four jumps. So \"around right\" is a modifier for the verb jump.\n\nIn the current input, \"run around left after walk left\", the structure is \"A after B\", so B is done before A. So first \"walk left\", then \"run around left\".\n\nAssuming that \"walk left\" is a command that requires walking to the left, which would require turning left first and then walking. But according to the rules, how to parse that. If \"walk left\" isn't a primitive verb, but the command could be interpreted as \"turn left then walk\", which would be I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK. Similarly, \"run around left\" would be 4 repetitions of [turn left + run], so each turn left followed by run, four times.\n\nWait, but how to parse \"walk left\". If the user intended \"walk left\" as a direction, then perhaps it's equivalent to \"turn left and walk\", which would be I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK. Because rule 5 says \"A and B\" = A then B. So if the command was \"turn left and walk\", then it would be turn left then walk. But here, the command is \"walk left\". Maybe the user phrased it as walk left, which is equivalent to \"walk after turning left\", which would be turn left then walk.\n\nAssuming that's the case, then", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The initial interpretation correctly applied the rule that 'A after B' means B then A.

The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Hmm, maybe \"look\" isn't an action here. Wait, the problem says I'm a semantic parsing agent for navigation commands, so maybe \"look\" is a command that translates to a specific action. But looking at the rules, the primitive verbs don't include \"look\". The example given uses jump around right, which maps to I_TURN_RIGHT and I_JUMP.\n\nWait, the user might have made a mistake, but according to the rules, \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. So maybe \"look\" is not an action here. But the input is \"look and turn left thrice\". If \"look\" isn't a valid verb, how to handle it? Wait, the problem says \"process this command\", so perhaps \"look\" should be ignored or there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is intended to be a no-op, but the rules don't mention that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem assumes that all verbs are primitive. The example uses \"jump\", which maps to I_JUMP. So if \"look\" isn't in the list, maybe it's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\" or another verb. But since the user provided the input, we need to process it as per the given rules. So perhaps \"look\" is not a valid verb here. However, in the example, \"jump\" is a verb. So the user's input might have a non-primitive verb. How to handle that?\n\nWait, the rules state that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So the input command can have other verbs, but they must be mapped according to the rules. But if \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, maybe it's not a valid command. But the problem says to process it. Maybe the correct approach is to ignore it or treat it as invalid. However, the user might expect a certain answer here. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is supposed to be a different action, but the rules don't specify it. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement. The first rule says \"Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions: walk→I_WALK, run→I_RUN, jump→I_JUMP, turn left→I_TURN_LEFT, turn right→I_TURN_RIGHT.\" So those are the only primitives. Then \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, so the command \"look\" would not translate to any action. But according to the problem's example, \"jump around right\" produces a sequence of actions. So how to handle \"look and turn left thrice\"?\n\nWait, the command is \"look and turn left thrice\". According to rule 5, \"A and B\" is A followed by B. So A is \"look\", which is a verb not in the primitive list. Therefore, perhaps \"look\" is invalid. But maybe the problem assumes that \"look\" is a verb that's not in the primitive list. However, the rules don't provide a mapping for it. This is confusing. Since the user provided this input, perhaps it's a trick question or maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\" or another verb.\n\nBut assuming the command is as written, and \"look\" is not a primitive verb, then according to the given rules, it can't be parsed. However, the problem expects us to process it. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is supposed to be ignored, but that's not specified in the rules. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a mistake, and the intended verb is \"walk\" or another primitive verb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a compound command, but the rules don't cover that. Hmm. Since the problem is presented as a test case, perhaps the \"look\" command here is irrelevant and the answer should ignore it, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to treat \"look\" as a valid verb with an implied action. However, the rules don't specify a mapping for \"look\", so perhaps it should be omitted. But the example uses \"jump\", which maps to I_JUMP, so each primitive verb must be mapped. Since \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, perhaps it's not part of the valid command. Therefore, the input might be invalid, but the problem expects us to process it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"left\", but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the input. However, given the input as is, I need to process it according to the rules. Wait, maybe \"look\" is a direction. Wait, no, directions are left/right. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\". If that's the case, then the command would be \"walk and turn left thrice\", which would be I_WALK followed by I_TURN_LEFT thrice. But that's speculative. However, since the problem gives the input as \"look and turn left thrice\", and given that the example uses \"turn left\" as part of the mapping, but \"look\" isn't in the primitive list, this seems like a problem. But perhaps the answer should ignore \"look\" or map it to nothing. Alternatively, maybe the answer should just process \"turn left thrice\" and ignore \"look\" because \"look\" isn't a primitive verb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\", but again, that's assuming. Alternatively, perhaps the answer should output nothing for \"look\", but the rules don't specify that. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is intended to be \"turn left\" here. But that's all guesswork.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a verb that requires a different action, but since it's not in the primitive list, the correct answer would be to output nothing for that part, but the problem might have intended \"walk\" instead. However, without explicit rules, this is unclear.\n\nBut given that the problem's example maps \"jump around right\" to a series of actions, and given that the input here is \"look and turn left thrice\", perhaps the correct approach is to consider \"look\" as invalid and then process \"turn left thrice\". However, according to the rules, \"A and B\" is to do A then B. If A is \"look\" and it's invalid, perhaps we can't process it. However, the problem may expect us to skip invalid verbs. But the problem's example doesn't have that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\". If that's the case, then the command would be \"walk and turn left thrice\", which would be I_WALK followed by I_TURN_LEFT repeated three times. But the problem says \"thrice\" applies to the verb, which would be \"turn left\" here. So \"turn left thrice\" would be I_TURN_LEFT three times.\n\nSo according to rule 4: \"A twice\" = repeat A twice. So \"turn left thrice\" would be I_TURN_LEFT repeated three times.\n\nSo the output would be I_WALK (from \"look\" if it's walk) then three I_TURN_LEFTs. But since \"look\" isn't a primitive, this is uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects us to ignore \"look\", then the output would be three I_TURN_LEFTs. But according to the rules, \"A and B\" is A then B. So if A is invalid, perhaps we can only process B. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem intended \"look\" to be a valid verb. Wait, but the rules don't list it. This seems like a contradiction. Maybe the answer is to output \"I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT\", ignoring the \"look\" as invalid. But the example outputs the actions in order. Alternatively, if \"look\" is not a primitive verb, perhaps it's skipped. But the problem's rules don't say to skip invalid verbs.\n\nHmm, this is a dilemma. However, given the problem's input, perhaps the intended answer is to ignore \"look\" and process the rest. But that's not according to the rules. Alternatively, the user may have made a mistake in the input. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a typo for \"jump left\" or something else. But given the input, the assistant must proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"run\". But again, without knowing, perhaps the answer should be the processing of \"turn left thrice\" which is three I_TURN_LEFT, and \"look\" is invalid. But according to the rules, the \"look\" command would not produce any action. However, the problem says \"process this command\", so perhaps we have to follow the rules strictly, even if part of the command can't be parsed.\n\nSo, according to rule 5: \"look and turn left thrice\" means do \"look\" then \"turn left thrice\". But \"look\" is not a primitive verb. Therefore, perhaps the action sequence for \"look\" is empty. Then, \"turn left thrice\" would be I_TURN_LEFT three times. So the output would be three I_TURN_LEFT actions.\n\nBut the problem's example includes the actions for the verb. So the final answer would be \"I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT\". But wait, the user wrote \"turn left thrice\" which is a verb followed by thrice. Rule 4 says \"verb twice", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 40, "model_reflection": "The input command is 'look and turn left thrice'. According to Rule 5, 'A and B' means do A then B in order. Therefore, 'look' should be processed first, followed by 'turn left thrice'.

The input is \"turn opposite right twice after turn around left thrice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part according to the rules. Let's start with the two main parts connected by \"after\". According to rule 5 and 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So the structure here is B (turn around left thrice) followed by A (turn opposite right twice).\n\nLet's tackle the B part first: \"turn around left thrice\". \n\n\"around left\" means 4 repetitions of [turn left + verb]. Here, the verb is \"turn\", but wait, \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, but the primitive verbs are turn left and turn right. Hmm. Wait, the command is \"turn around left\". So \"around left\" would be 4 repetitions of [turn left + verb]. But the verb here is \"turn\", which might not make sense. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck. The command is \"turn around left thrice\". Breaking it down: \"turn\" is the verb, but \"around left\" is a modifier. According to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the main verb here is \"turn\", but modified by \"around left\". Wait, but \"turn around left\" would be parsed as: around left applies to the verb \"turn\". So according to rule 3, \"turn around left\" would be 4 times [turn left followed by turn]. Wait, but that seems a bit odd. Let me make sure.\n\nRule 3 says: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the original verb is replaced by this sequence. So \"turn around left\" would be 4 repetitions of [turn left + turn]. Wait, but \"turn\" is the original verb. Wait, the example given in the problem was \"jump around right\" becomes four turns right and jumps each time. So for \"verb around DIR\", each repetition is \"turn DIR then verb\". So if the verb here is \"turn\", then each step would be \"turn left then turn\". Wait, but \"turn\" here would be a direction? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. Let's take the example. For \"jump around right\", the output is four times [turn right then jump]. So the verb is \"jump\", and \"around right\" modifies it to be done four times after each turn. So similarly, \"turn around left\" would be the verb \"turn\" modified by \"around left\", resulting in four repetitions of [turn left then turn]. But wait, the verb \"turn\" needs a direction. Wait, but according to the primitive verbs, \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are the primitives. So \"turn\" by itself isn't a primitive. So maybe the original command \"turn around left\" is a bit ambiguous. Wait, but the input is \"turn around left\", so the verb is \"turn\" with direction \"left\", but modified by \"around left\". Wait, perhaps the correct parsing is that \"turn around left\" is a command where \"around left\" is modifying \"turn\". But since the primitive verbs are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\", perhaps \"turn\" alone isn't valid. So maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement. The rules say that primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn\" without a direction isn't a primitive. Therefore, perhaps the command \"turn around left\" is invalid, but given the problem's example, the user expects us to parse it. Wait, the input here is \"turn around left thrice after ...\", so let's think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"turn\" in \"turn around left\" is part of the phrase. Maybe \"turn around left\" is equivalent to turning left twice? Wait, but rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, \"around left\" modifying \"turn\" would be 4 repetitions of [turn left + turn]. But the verb here is \"turn\", but \"turn\" isn't a primitive. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the original command is \"turn around left\" and that's equivalent to making a full circle. For example, turning left four times would be a full circle, but \"around left\" would be four times turning left each time and then doing the verb. Wait, but the example shows that \"jump around right\" becomes four turns right and four jumps. So each repetition is first turn in DIR, then do the verb. So in the case of \"turn around left\", the verb is \"turn\", so each step would be [turn left + turn]. But \"turn\" here must have a direction. Wait, maybe the original verb here is \"turn left\" or \"turn right\". So perhaps the structure is different.\n\nWait, maybe \"turn around left\" is parsed as follows: the verb is \"turn left\", and \"around\" would be modifying it. Wait, but the input is \"turn around left\", which might parse as \"turn\" being the verb with \"around left\" as a modifier. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that \"turn around left\" is a compound verb. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that \"turn around left\" is equivalent to turning left twice? No, because \"opposite left\" would be two left turns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that \"around left\" when applied to a turn verb would result in multiple turns left. Wait, but according to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" means 4 repetitions of [turn DIR then verb]. So regardless of the verb, each repetition is a turn in DIR direction followed by the verb. So in the example \"jump around right\", the verb is jump, so each repetition is turn right then jump. So in that case, if the verb is \"turn left\", then \"turn left around right\" would be four times [turn right then turn left]. But in the current problem, the verb here is \"turn\" (without direction?), which is not a primitive. Hmm. This suggests that maybe the input command is invalid, but since it's given as input, perhaps I need to parse it as per some assumptions.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the \"turn\" in \"turn around left\" is redundant, and the actual direction is from the \"around left\". Wait, maybe the user made a mistake here, but according to the input, we need to process it. Let me re-express the original input again.\n\nOriginal input: \"turn opposite right twice after turn around left thrice\"\n\nBreaking it into parts:\n\nThe main structure is \"A after B\" which means B then A. So B is \"turn around left thrice\", and A is \"turn opposite right twice\".\n\nWe need to process B first, then A.\n\nProcessing B: \"turn around left thrice\"\n\nFirst, \"around left\" applies to the verb \"turn\". According to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" means 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So here, the verb is \"turn\". Therefore, each repetition would be [turn left, turn]. Wait, but \"turn\" isn't a primitive. So perhaps this is invalid, but maybe \"turn\" here is a typo and should be \"turn left\" or \"turn right\". Alternatively, perhaps the verb in this case is \"turn left\", but that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original verb in \"around left\" is \"walk\", but here it's \"turn\". Wait, perhaps \"turn\" is a mistake, but given that it's in the input, I need to parse it as per the rules, even if it's not a valid primitive. Wait, but according to rule 1, primitive verbs are the ones listed. So \"turn\" without direction is not a primitive. Therefore, \"turn around left\" would be invalid. However, the problem gives this input, so perhaps we can proceed.\n\nWait, maybe \"turn around left\" here is equivalent to \"turn left\" four times? Because \"around left\" would be four times [turn left + verb], but the verb here would be \"turn\", which is invalid. Alternatively, maybe the verb is \"turn left\", but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended \"turn around left\" to be \"turn left twice\", which would be the opposite. But according to rule 2, \"opposite left\" is two left turns. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that \"turn around left\" is a standard command meaning to turn left three times? Or maybe to turn right four times? No, but according to the rules, \"around left\" should be four repetitions. Let's try to proceed as per the rules, even if \"turn\" isn't a primitive.\n\nSo, \"around left\" would be four repetitions of [turn left then turn]. But \"turn\" here would have to be a verb. Since \"turn\" isn't a primitive, this might be invalid, but perhaps the problem assumes that \"turn\" here is equivalent to \"turn left\" or \"turn right\". Alternatively, perhaps the original verb is \"turn left\", so \"around left\" applied to \"turn left\" would be four times [turn left then turn left], leading to eight left turns. But that's possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the original command \"turn around left\" is parsed as \"turn left around left\", but that's not the case. The input is \"turn around left\", which could be parsed as verb \"turn\" with \"around left\" modifying it. But since \"turn\" isn't a valid primitive, maybe this is", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The breakdown of the command followed the rules systematically.

Similarly, 'opposite right' was expanded using Rule 2 into two right turns followed by a turn, and repeated twice as required. The final concatenation of the two parts in the correct order aligns with the semantics of the command.

The input is \"turn right thrice and walk around left twice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part according to the rules. \n\nStarting with \"turn right thrice\". The rule for \"thrice\" is that it repeats the verb three times. \"turn right\" maps to I_TURN_RIGHT. So doing that three times would be I_TURN_RIGHT repeated three times.\n\nNext is \"walk around left twice\". Let's split this. The \"around left\" part follows rule 3, which says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb is \"walk\" (I_WALK), and DIR is left. So each around left would be turning left then walking, four times. But then the \"twice\" applies to the entire \"walk around left\", so we need to repeat the around left sequence twice. \n\nWait, wait. Wait. The structure is \"walk around left twice\". The \"twice\" here applies to the entire \"walk around left\"? Or does \"around left twice\" change the repetition? Hmm. Let me check the rules again.\n\nRule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 reps of [turn DIR + verb]. But here, the user wrote \"around left twice\". Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the original rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. But in the input, we have \"around left twice\". Wait, the user's input is \"walk around left twice\". Let me parse this. \n\nWait, the command structure is \"walk around left twice\". According to the rules, \"around <DIR>\" is rule 3. So \"around left\" would be 4 repetitions of [turn left + walk]. Then \"twice\" applies to that entire around action. Wait, no. Wait, the \"twice\" here is after \"around left twice\". Wait, \"walk around left twice\" could be parsed as \"walk around left\" done twice. Or maybe \"walk around left\" with the around being modified by twice? Wait, but the rules say that \"around <DIR>\" is fixed to four repetitions. But the presence of \"twice\" complicates things. Wait, no. Rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" equals four repetitions, so \"around left\" is four times. Then \"around left twice\" would be twice the entire around left sequence? Or does the \"twice\" modify the around? Hmm, perhaps the \"twice\" applies to the entire verb phrase. Let's look at the example in the problem. The example input is \"jump around right\", output is four pairs of turn right and jump. So \"around right\" is four times. So \"around\" by itself is four times. Now, in the current problem, the input is \"walk around left twice\". So \"walk around left\" is parsed as \"walk around left\", but then \"twice\"? Or \"walk around left twice\" would be \"walk around left\" done twice? Because \"around\" already has a repetition. Hmm. Let's parse the structure.\n\nBreaking down \"walk around left twice\". According to the rules, modifiers like \"around\", \"twice\" have to be considered. The rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions. Then \"verb twice\" is two repetitions of the verb. But how do they combine here. Is \"walk around left twice\" equivalent to \"walk around left\" done twice? Or is \"around left twice\" a different case. Wait, no. The \"around left\" is a single verb modifier. So the structure here is \"walk around left\" which would be rule 3, four repetitions of [turn left + walk], and then \"twice\" would apply to that entire sequence. Alternatively, perhaps \"twice\" applies to the verb before \"around\". Hmm. Let's parse the phrase step by step.\n\nOriginal command: \"turn right thrice and walk around left twice\". \n\nThe first part: \"turn right thrice\" → \"turn right\" is I_TURN_RIGHT, thrice → repeat three times. So three I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nThen \"walk around left twice\". \"around left\" is rule 3, so four times [turn left + walk]. Then \"twice\" would mean doing that entire around sequence twice. Wait, but the rule says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions. So \"walk around left\" would be the four-step sequence. Then \"twice\" would mean do that entire four-step sequence twice. Alternatively, \"twice\" could be modifying the \"walk\", but according to rule 5 and 6, \"A and B\" is A followed by B, and modifiers like \"twice\" apply to the verb. But perhaps \"walk around left twice\" is parsed as \"walk around left\" done twice. Let's think. \n\nRule 4 says that \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions. So \"walk around left\" would be:\n\n[turn left, walk] repeated four times. Then \"twice\" would mean repeating this entire sequence twice. Therefore, the entire \"walk around left\" becomes the four-step sequence, then repeated twice. Wait, but the user says \"around left twice\", but in the command, it's \"walk around left twice\". So \"twice\" would be modifying the entire \"walk around left\" action. Or maybe \"around left\" is four times, but then \"twice\" would be a modifier on top of that? That would be 2*(4 repetitions), but that's not according to the rules. Wait, the rules are that \"around <DIR>\" is 4, and \"verb twice\" is two times. So the key is to parse the structure as per the rules. \n\nBreaking down \"walk around left twice\":\n\nThe verb is \"walk\" which maps to I_WALK.\n\nBut \"around left\" is a modifier on the verb. So \"walk around left\" would be the verb (walk) with the around modifier. Then \"twice\" applies to the entire verb plus modifier. So the entire \"walk around left\" sequence is done twice.\n\nWait, but how does \"around\" and \"twice\" interact? For example, in the example, \"jump around right\" gives four turns and four jumps. So \"around\" already does four times. So if we had \"jump around right twice\", that would be the around sequence (four times) done twice. So each \"around\" is four times, so \"jump around right twice\" would be two times the four sequences. So how would that parse?\n\nBut according to the rules, the \"around\" applies first. So the structure would be:\n\nFor \"walk around left twice\":\n\n- The verb is \"walk\" modified by \"around left\" and then \"twice\".\n\n- So \"around left\" applied to \"walk\" gives four repetitions of [turn left + walk].\n\n- Then \"twice\" would mean that the entire sequence of those four repetitions is repeated twice. So total of 8 actions (but each repetition is turn left, walk, so 4 * 2 actions = 8, and then twice that would be 16 actions). Wait, but that's a lot. Wait, but according to the rules, how?\n\nRule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions. Rule 4 says that \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of the verb. Wait, wait, no. Wait, rule 3 says: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Rule 4: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each \"around left\" would be turn left, walk, four times. So for \"walk around left\", we have:\n\nturn left walk turn left walk turn left walk turn left walk\n\n(Each [turn left + walk] repeated four times.)\n\nNow, \"walk around left twice\" would be the entire \"around left\" sequence done twice. So the four repetitions multiplied by two. So total of 8 [turn left + walk] steps. Wait, but according to the rules, \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So the original verb here is \"walk around left\", which is the entire around sequence. So \"walk around left twice\" would be doing that entire around sequence twice.\n\nWait, according to rule 4, the \"around left\" is part of the verb's processing. So the verb plus around would be the four repetitions, and then \"twice\" would multiply that. So yes, each \"walk around left\" is four [turn left + walk], then doing that twice would be repeating that four times two times? Or wait, no. Wait, \"walk around left\" is the verb plus around, which becomes four times [turn left + walk]. Then \"twice\" would repeat that entire block twice. So the \"walk around left\" is a single action that produces four [turn left + walk], and then \"twice\" would repeat that block twice. So total of 4*2 times of [turn left + walk].\n\nSo the processing steps:\n\nFirst part: turn right thrice.\n\nturn right maps to I_TURN_RIGHT. Thrice means repeat three times. So:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSecond part: walk around left twice.\n\nWalk around left is processed as [turn left walk] four times. Then twice means doing that entire around action two times. So each around is four [turn left walk], then twice would make it eight [turn left walk]. Wait, no: the around action as a single unit, which when done once produces four [turn left walk]. So twice would be doing that around unit twice.

The input is \"look around right after walk around left twice\". Hmm, first, I need to parse this according to the rules provided. \n\nWait, but looking at the rules, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Oh, but \"look\" isn't listed here. The example didn't include \"look\" either. Maybe \"look\" isn't a primitive verb here. So does that mean that \"look\" is not an action that we can process? But the problem says to process the command, so perhaps \"look\" is ignored or there's a mistake. Wait, no, the user might have intended that \"look\" is part of the command, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are only the ones listed. So maybe \"look\" isn't a valid verb here. However, the user might have made a mistake, but I need to handle it as per the rules.\n\nWait, but the problem says I'm a semantic parsing agent for navigation commands. The rules state that primitive verbs map to certain actions. So if \"look\" is not in the list, then how do I handle it? The example uses \"jump around right\" which translates to turning right and jumping four times. So the verbs in the input must be the primitive verbs. Since \"look\" is not a primitive verb, maybe it's a mistake. However, perhaps the user intended for \"look\" to be part of the command. But according to the rules, I should only process the verbs listed as primitives. Therefore, maybe \"look\" is not part of the action sequence and should be ignored? Or maybe it's a typo. Hmm, but the problem might have a typo. Alternatively, maybe \"look around\" is treated as a verb, but the rules don't mention that. Let me check the rules again.\n\nRule 1 says: Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. The list includes walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" is not a primitive verb. Therefore, perhaps the command is invalid, but the problem expects me to process it. Wait, but the input is given as \"look around right after walk around left twice\", so maybe \"look\" is a mistake, and the intended verb is \"walk\" or another. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the input. However, since I have to process according to the rules, perhaps \"look\" is not part of the actions, but the structure of the command matters. Wait, but the entire command must be parsed. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, the example input is \"jump around right\" and the output uses I_JUMP. So the verb is \"jump\". The problem here is \"look around right\" followed by \"after\" and \"walk around left twice\". If \"look\" is not a primitive, then how to handle? Maybe this is a trick question. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is supposed to be ignored, but that's not clear. Wait, perhaps the user intended \"look around right\" to be parsed as \"around right\" with the verb \"look\", but since \"look\" is not a primitive, we can't generate the action. However, according to the rules, we have to output the sequence of actions. So perhaps \"look\" is not part of the actions, but the structure is considered. Wait, but the rules state that the output is the sequence of actions. If the verb is not primitive, then perhaps we can't process that part. But the problem is presented as a test, so maybe there's a way to parse this. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\" or \"jump\". But assuming the input is correct, maybe I should proceed. Wait, perhaps the \"look around right\" is structured as \"around right\" modifying \"look\", but \"look\" isn't a primitive, so we can't proceed. But this seems like a problem. Maybe the input is a trick question, but perhaps the answer ignores \"look\"? Or maybe \"look\" maps to an action not listed. But according to the problem, we must follow the rules strictly. Hmm. Maybe the problem has a typo, and \"look\" should be \"walk\" or another verb. But given that, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a mistake, and the correct verb is one of the primitives, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the command structure is \"A after B\", which is \"B then A\". The command is \"look around right after walk around left twice\". So according to rule 6: A after B = do B then A. Here, A is \"look around right\", and B is \"walk around left twice\". But since \"look\" isn't a primitive, maybe the entire A part is invalid. But perhaps the user intended \"walk\" and \"look\" is a typo. Alternatively, perhaps \"look around right\" is a command that's not captured by the rules. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, but the problem expects an answer, so perhaps \"look\" is supposed to be treated as a verb, even though it's not listed. But according to the rules, that's not allowed. So maybe the answer is that there's an invalid verb. But the example didn't include error handling. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake, but the assistant should proceed with the given input. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\" or another verb. Let's assume that \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\", but that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to test the structure regardless of the verb, so even if \"look\" is not a primitive, the structure is parsed. But according to the rules, the output should be the sequence of actions based on the primitives. Therefore, if \"look\" is not a primitive, that action isn't in the output. But that would leave nothing. Hmm. Maybe the problem is intended to ignore the verb and process the structure. Wait, but the example uses the verb. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the structure of the command even with unknown verbs. But according to the rules, only the listed verbs are allowed. Therefore, the input command is invalid because \"look\" is not a primitive. But the problem is presented, so maybe the answer should process the structure, perhaps with placeholders. But the rules state that only the verbs listed are primitives. Therefore, this is a problem. Wait, maybe the verb \"look\" is supposed to be ignored, but the structure \"around right\" is applied to some previous action, but that's unclear. Since the problem is presented, perhaps the intended solution is to process \"walk around left twice\" first, then \"look around right\". But \"look\" isn't a verb. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that \"look around right\" is treated as a verb phrase, but since \"look\" isn't a primitive, it's not part of the actions. But I'm stuck. Let me try to proceed. Let's parse the command as per the structure, assuming that \"look\" is a valid verb. Wait, but according to the rules, only the listed verbs are allowed. So if \"look\" is not in the list, then this command can't be processed. But since the user provided it, perhaps it's a mistake, but we need to proceed. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\". Let's assume that. Suppose the input was \"jump around right after walk around left twice\". Then the processing would be possible. But with the given input, perhaps the answer would be to ignore the \"look\" part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to test the structure regardless of the verb. But the rules state that verbs must be mapped. Hmm.\n\nLet me try to proceed. Let's parse the command: \"look around right after walk around left twice\". According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So the entire command is equivalent to doing B first, then A. Where A is \"look around right\" and B is \"walk around left twice\". Then B is \"walk around left twice\", which is a repetition of \"around left\" twice. Now, \"around left\" is rule 3: 4 repetitions of [turn left + verb]. So \"walk around left\" would be applying around to walk. So each around is four times turn left then walk. Then \"around left twice\" would be doing the around left two times? Wait, no. Wait, the command is \"walk around left twice\". According to rule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"walk around left\" is \"around left\" applied to walk, which is 4 repetitions of [turn left + walk]. Then \"twice\" would mean repeating the entire \"walk around left\" sequence twice. Wait, no. Wait, the original command is \"walk around left twice\". The \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. So first parse \"walk around left\", which is \"around right/left\" applied to verb. So \"around left\" applied to \"walk\" would be 4 repetitions of [turn left then walk]. Then \"twice\" would mean repeating that entire sequence twice. So the total for \"walk around left twice\" would be 2 times the 4 repetitions. But wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"walk around left\" is 4 repetitions of turn left then walk. Then \"twice\" would mean that the entire \"around left\" action is done twice. Wait, no: rule 4 says \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice.

Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look opposite right\" is equivalent to \"turn opposite right\", which would be two turns in the right direction. Wait, but \"look\" would then be a verb that's not in the primitives. Alternatively, maybe \"look opposite right\" should be treated as \"turn opposite right\", but that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the \"look\" part. But that's not a good approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended \"look\" to be a verb that's equivalent to \"turn left\" or some other action. But without explicit mapping, this is impossible. Therefore, this seems to be a problem. However, perhaps the original problem intended to include \"look\" as a primitive verb, but forgot. Alternatively, perhaps this is a test to see if I follow the rules strictly. In that case, I should note that \"look\" is not a primitive, and cannot be processed. However, the problem expects an output. Therefore, perhaps \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\". Let's assume that for now. But that's a risky assumption. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" should be ignored. But again, that's not specified in the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look opposite right\" is equivalent to \"turn opposite right\", which would be two turns right. Wait, but then the verb would be \"turn left\", perhaps. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the \"look\" verb is a red herring, and the problem is designed to see if the agent can handle the other parts. For example, even if \"look\" is present, but the output ignores it. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look\" is a primitive verb that maps to I_LOOK, which is not listed. But according to the rules, it's not. Therefore, I can't do that. Hmm. This seems like a critical problem. However, given that the user provided this input, I need to proceed. Let's try to parse the input, even if there's a non-primitive verb.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem's first rule says that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions, but maybe there are other verbs. But in the example, the output uses the mapped actions. So if \"look\" was a verb, and not in the list, then perhaps it's invalid. So perhaps the correct output would be to ignore \"look\" and process the rest. But that's not specified in the rules. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is supposed to be treated as a typo and ignored, but the problem is about the other parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look opposite right twice and jump left\" should be parsed as two parts: \"look opposite right twice\" and \"jump left\", connected by \"and\". So \"A and B\" means A then B. So first process \"look opposite right twice\", then process \"jump left\".\n\nBut the first part \"look opposite right twice\" includes \"look\", which isn't a primitive. So if \"look\" can't be processed, how to proceed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look opposite right\" is equivalent to \"turn opposite right\", which would be \"turn left\", since opposite right is two right turns, which faces backward. Wait, according to rule 2: opposite <DIR> equals two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"opposite right\" would mean two turns right, then the verb. But the verb here is \"look\", which isn't a primitive. Hmm.\n\nBut given that the system must produce an output, perhaps the problem expects us to treat \"look\" as a valid verb. Let's proceed with that assumption, perhaps \"look\" maps to I_LOOK, even though it's not listed in the rules. Or perhaps it's a typo for \"walk\". Alternatively, perhaps the original problem intended to include \"look\" in the primitives. Otherwise, the input would be invalid, but the problem expects an answer.\n\nAssuming that \"look\" is a valid primitive verb, which maps to I_LOOK (even though it's not in the list), then proceed. But the rules don't mention that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended \"look\" to be \"turn left\" or \"turn right\", but I can't tell. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is intended to be a verb that isn't converted into an action. But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and \"look\" should be \"walk\". Then \"walk opposite right twice and jump left\". But that's speculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look\" is irrelevant, and the command should be parsed as \"opposite right twice\" modifying the jump.

The input is \"walk right twice after jump left thrice\". I need to parse this into the correct sequence of actions based on the given rules.\n\nFirst, let's break down the command. The main structure here is \"A after B\", which according to rule 6 means B is executed first, then A. So \"walk right twice\" is A, and \"jump left thrice\" is B. So the order should be B then A.\n\nNow, let's handle each part separately. Starting with B: \"jump left thrice\". This uses rule 4 for \"thrice\", which means repeating the verb sequence three times. The verb here is \"jump left\". Wait, \"jump left\" is a compound verb. But according to the rules, each verb is primitive. Wait, no. Wait, \"jump left\" might be a problem here. Wait, the primitive verbs are listed as walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump left\" isn't a primitive. Wait, but the user wrote \"jump left thrice\". Hmm. Wait, that's a conflict. Wait, the rules state that primitive verbs are the ones that map to actions. So \"jump left\" isn't a primitive. So how to parse this?\n\nWait, the input is \"jump left thrice\". Let me check the rules again. Rule 1 says primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump left\" isn't a primitive; that's confusing. But maybe the user made a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the input is supposed to be parsed as \"jump left\" as a verb, but according to the rules, \"jump\" is a verb, and \"left\" is a direction. Hmm. Wait, \"jump\" is a primitive verb, but \"jump left\" isn't listed. So perhaps this input is using \"jump\" as the verb and \"left\" as a direction, but that doesn't make sense because jump doesn't take a direction. Wait, maybe the input is \"jump after left\", but no. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the input is \"jump left thrice\". So \"jump left\" is a verb phrase. But according to the rules, the primitive verbs are only walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump left\" isn't a primitive. Therefore, this might be an error, but since the user provided this, I need to parse it. Maybe the user intended \"jump\" and \"left\" as separate actions? No. Wait, perhaps the \"left\" here is part of the verb. Wait, perhaps the command is \"jump\" modified by \"left\", but according to the primitives, that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be \"turn left\" followed by jump, but the input is \"jump left thrice\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is a misinterpretation here. Wait, the rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" maps to two turns in DIR then the verb. Rule 3 is \"around <DIR>\" as four repetitions. So maybe \"jump left\" here is a \"verb + direction\" that's not part of the primitives. But given the problem, maybe the user intended \"jump\" and \"left\" as two separate verbs? No. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, perhaps the input should be parsed as \"jump\" and \"turn left\" as separate actions. Wait, but the input is \"jump left thrice\". Let's think again.\n\nWait, maybe the command is structured as \"jump left\" thrice. But since \"jump left\" isn't a primitive, perhaps the parser should split into \"jump\" and \"left\", which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended \"turn left\" and then \"jump\", but that's not clear.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the input. Alternatively, maybe \"jump left\" is a typo for \"turn left\", but I need to proceed. Let's consider that the user might have made an error. Alternatively, perhaps the input should be parsed as \"jump\" followed by \"left\" (turn left), but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the command is \"jump\" modified by \"left\", but according to the rules, \"jump\" is a primitive verb, so \"left\" here may be a direction. However, jump doesn't take direction. So perhaps \"jump left\" is invalid. But the problem expects me to parse it. Maybe the user intended \"jump\" and \"left\" as separate actions? No. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the input is \"jump left\" as a single action, but since it's not a primitive, this would be invalid. But the user provided this, so maybe the correct approach is to assume that \"jump\" is the verb and \"left\" is a direction, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended \"turn left then jump\", but phrased as \"jump left\", which isn't a rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's proceed. The input is \"jump left thrice\". Since \"jump\" is a primitive verb and \"left\" is a direction, but how do they combine? The rules don't specify any structure where a verb takes a direction. The only rules are \"opposite <DIR>\" and \"around <DIR>\", which are modifiers. So \"jump left\" doesn't fit into any of the rules. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the input. However, given that the example uses \"jump around right\", which uses the 'around' rule with direction, perhaps the user intended \"walk right twice\" and \"jump left thrice\" as separate parts. So maybe \"walk right twice\" is \"walk\" modified by \"right twice\", and \"jump left thrice\" is \"jump\" modified by \"left thrice\".\n\nWait, but how to parse \"walk right twice\"? Let's see. The main command is \"walk right twice after jump left thrice\". So according to the structure \"A after B\", B is \"jump left thrice\" and A is \"walk right twice\".\n\nSo first parse B: \"jump left thrice\".\n\nAssuming \"jump left\" is a verb plus direction, but according to the rules, direction modifiers are \"opposite <DIR>\" and \"around <DIR>\". So \"left\" here is not a modifier in those rules. Then perhaps \"jump\" and \"left\" are separate verbs? No, but \"left\" is a direction. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe \"jump left\" is a mistake and the user meant \"turn left then jump\", but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is \"jump\" as verb and \"left\" as a direction, which is not covered by the rules. Therefore, perhaps the input is invalid. But the problem expects us to process it. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is being treated as a single verb, but not in the primitives. Therefore, perhaps the parser should ignore that and proceed as per the rules. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, maybe the problem expects that \"walk right twice\" is parsed as \"walk right\" twice, but according to the rules, \"twice\" repeats the verb sequence. So \"walk right\" as a verb sequence, then repeat it twice. Wait, but \"walk right\" would be two verbs: walk and right? No. Wait, \"walk right\" could be \"walk\" followed by \"turn right\", but according to the rules, \"right\" as a direction would be in \"turn right\" primitive. But \"walk right\" isn't a primitive. So perhaps \"walk right\" is parsed as \"walk\" and then \"turn right\", but that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"right\" in \"walk right\" is a direction modifier. Wait, according to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" becomes two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"opposite left walk\" would be turn left, turn left, walk. Similarly, if \"walk right\" were structured as \"walk\" with a direction, but the rules don't mention direction modifiers except for \"opposite\" and \"around\". Therefore, perhaps \"walk right\" is not a valid construction under the rules. Which suggests that the input might have an error, but since we need to process it, perhaps we should consider that \"walk right\" is intended to be \"turn right then walk\", but according to which rule? Rule 2 is for \"opposite\", not just direction. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"walk right twice\" is parsed as \"walk\" followed by \"right twice\". But \"right twice\" would be a modifier. Not sure. This seems like a dead end.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the input is \"walk right twice after jump left thrice\", and the correct way to parse \"walk right twice\" is as a verb \"walk\", then \"right twice\". But \"right\" isn't a verb, but a direction. Alternatively, \"walk right\" could be a mistake, but given that the example uses \"jump around right\", which uses the 'around' rule, maybe in this case, \"right\" in \"walk right\" is a direction modifier using a different rule. But there's no rule that specifies a verb followed by a direction unless it's \"opposite\" or \"around\".\n\nThis is a problem. Let's try to re-express the input. Maybe \"walk right\" should be interpreted as \"walk\" in the right direction, but the rules don't account for movement direction. The actions are all directionless except for the turn actions. So \"walk\" is just forward, regardless of direction. Therefore, perhaps \"right\" in this case is a direction modifier for a turn. So maybe \"walk right", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 60, "model_reflection": "Upon re-evaluation, the interpretation of 'walk right' and 'jump left' was incorrect. According to the rules, verbs like 'walk' and 'jump' are mapped directly to their uppercase primitives (I_WALK, I_JUMP), while directional phrases like 'right' or 'left' that follow verbs should be interpreted as turns (I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_LEFT). However, in the original parsing, the structure of 'jump left' and 'walk right' was treated as verb + turn, which implies that the directional component was treated as a separate action rather than part of the verb phrase. This is inconsistent with the example provided, where 'jump around right' is interpreted as verb + direction, not verb followed by turn. Therefore, 'jump left' should be interpreted as a single action I_JUMP_LEFT (not I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT), and 'walk right' as I_WALK_RIGHT. Additionally, the repetition rules for 'twice' and 'thrice' apply to the entire verb-direction pair.

The input is \"turn opposite left twice and look twice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part according to the rules. Starting with \"turn opposite left twice\". The rule for \"opposite <DIR>\" says it's two turns in DIR direction followed by the verb. Wait, the verb here is \"turn\", so the original instruction is \"turn opposite left twice\". Wait, maybe I need to parse \"opposite left\" as the direction. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is \"opposite <DIR>\" which modifies the verb. Let me re-examine rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" means two turns in DIR then the verb. So if the command is \"turn opposite left\", then the verb is \"turn\", which would map to I_TURN. Wait, but \"turn\" here is part of the primitive verb. So \"turn opposite left\" would be interpreted as two turns in DIR (left) then the verb. Wait, the original verb is \"turn\". Hmm, maybe the command \"turn opposite left\" would be parsed as two turns left, then turn. But that seems confusing. Wait, let's take the example from the rules. For example, if the command was \"walk opposite left\", then according to rule 2, it would be two left turns then walk. So each \"opposite <DIR>\" modifies the verb that precedes it. But in the given input, the command is \"turn opposite left twice\". Wait, the phrase is \"turn opposite left twice\". So \"turn opposite left\" is the action, and then \"twice\" applies to that action.\n\nSo \"turn opposite left\" would be parsed as two turns left (since opposite left means two left turns) followed by the verb. But the verb here is \"turn\". Wait, but \"turn opposite left\" would be the verb. Wait, no. Let me clarify. The structure is: the verb is modified by \"opposite left\". The original verb is \"turn\", but \"opposite left\" would mean that the direction is opposite. Wait, maybe the command is \"turn opposite left\" as in \"turn in the opposite left direction\". But according to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" means two turns in DIR direction then the verb. So \"turn opposite left\" would mean two left turns, then turn. Wait, but that seems like three turns. Hmm. Let's take the example given. For instance, in the example \"jump around right\" becomes four repetitions of turn right then jump. So each \"around\" involves turning and then the action. So in rule 2, \"opposite left\" would mean two left turns, then the verb. So if the verb is \"turn left\", but wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nIn the example, the verb is \"jump\", and \"around right\" is 4 repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So the \"around\" applies to the verb. Similarly, \"opposite left\" would modify the verb. So \"turn opposite left\" would be parsed as two left turns, then the verb. Wait, but the verb here is \"turn\". Wait, but \"turn opposite left\" might not be a standard verb. Wait, perhaps the command is \"turn opposite left twice\". Wait, the input is \"turn opposite left twice and look twice\". So the first part is \"turn opposite left twice\", and the second part is \"look twice\". The two parts are connected by \"and\", so according to rule 5, do A then B, where A is \"turn opposite left twice\" and B is \"look twice\".\n\nLet's focus on \"turn opposite left twice\". Breaking it down, \"turn opposite left\" is the action modified by \"twice\". Now, \"opposite left\" as per rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So the verb here is \"turn\", so \"turn opposite left\" would translate to two left turns followed by the verb (turn). Wait, but \"turn\" is the verb. So \"turn opposite left\" would be two left turns, then turn. Wait, but \"turn\" could be either left or right, but in the primitive verbs, we have \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". So perhaps \"turn opposite left\" is a way to indicate a direction. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"verb\" in rule 2 refers to the primitive verb. For example, if the command is \"walk opposite left\", then the verb is \"walk\". So the action would be: turn left, turn left (two turns), then walk. So the entire sequence for \"walk opposite left\" is two lefts then walk. Similarly, \"turn opposite left\" would have the verb as \"turn\", which would require a direction. Wait, but \"turn\" isn't a direction. Hmm, maybe \"turn opposite left\" is redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the command, but according to the problem statement, we need to parse it as per the rules.\n\nWait, the command is \"turn opposite left twice\". Let's parse this as \"turn opposite left\" modified by \"twice\". But \"turn opposite left\" itself is parsed as two left turns followed by the verb. The verb here is \"turn\", but \"turn\" by itself isn't a primitive verb. Wait, the primitive verbs are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". Oh, wait! The primitive verbs are \"walk\", \"run\", \"jump\", \"turn left\", \"turn right\". So each verb must be one of these. So \"turn opposite left\" isn't a primitive verb, which complicates things. Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Let me re-examine the command.\n\nWait, the input is \"turn opposite left twice and look twice\". Wait, \"look\" isn't a primitive verb in the rules given. Wait, the rules say that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions, and the examples given are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, this might be a problem. But according to the problem statement, we need to process the command as given. Maybe \"look\" is a typo, but assuming that \"look\" is supposed to be treated as a verb, but since it's not in the list, perhaps we have to proceed regardless. Wait, but the user might have intended \"look\" to be a primitive verb. Alternatively, perhaps the example in the problem statement only lists some verbs, but in reality, there could be others. However, according to the problem's first rule, the given verbs are the only ones that map to actions. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, the input here is \"look twice\". So if \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, then how to handle it? But the example given in the problem has \"jump around right\" mapped to turn right and jump four times. So perhaps any verb can be used, even if not in the list. Or maybe \"look\" maps to an action I_LOOK. But the problem statement says that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So unless \"look\" is a primitive verb (which according to the first rule, it's not), then this is an issue. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake, but I need to proceed. Maybe \"look\" should be treated as a valid primitive verb. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be \"left\", but that's speculation. Let's proceed assuming that \"look\" is a valid primitive verb mapping to I_LOOK. Otherwise, the problem can't be solved. The problem must have intended that.\n\nSo proceeding, assuming that \"look\" is a primitive verb that maps to I_LOOK. Now, back to the command: \"turn opposite left twice and look twice\".\n\nBreaking down \"turn opposite left twice\". The phrase \"opposite left\" applies to the verb \"turn left\"? Wait, no. According to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, the structure is: the command is a verb modified by \"opposite DIR\". For example, \"jump opposite left\" would be two left turns, then jump. So the verb is \"jump\". Similarly, \"turn left opposite left\" would be two left turns, then turn left. Wait, but \"turn left\" is the verb. So \"opposite left\" in the context of \"turn left opposite left\" would be two left turns then turn left. But maybe the input here is \"turn opposite left\", which would parse as two left turns then turn. But \"turn\" isn't a valid primitive verb. Wait, but the primitive verbs are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\", so \"turn\" alone isn't valid. So perhaps the input is \"turn left opposite left\", but that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the \"turn\" in \"turn opposite left\" is part of the verb. Hmm. Let me parse this carefully.\n\nOriginal command part: \"turn opposite left twice\". The verb here is \"turn\" followed by \"opposite left\". Wait, perhaps the \"opposite left\" is modifying the direction of the turn. So according to rule 2, \"opposite left\" would mean two turns left followed by the verb. But the verb here is \"turn\", which is not a valid primitive verb. Wait, this seems conflicting. Alternatively, maybe \"turn opposite left\" is equivalent to \"turn right\" because opposite left would be right. But according to the rules, we need to follow the given transformations. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"turn opposite left\" is parsed as \"turn in the opposite direction of left\", which is right.

The input is \"run opposite left twice after look right twice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part according to the rules. Let's start with the individual components.\n\n\"run opposite left twice\" – this part needs to be handled. The rule for \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in the direction, then the verb. So opposite left would be two left turns (which would face the opposite direction) then run. Wait, but the verb here is run. So \"run opposite left\" would be turning left twice, then run. Wait, no: the rule says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. So \"opposite left\" would be two turns left, then the verb (run). So \"run opposite left\" translates to two I_TURN_LEFT actions followed by I_RUN. But then there's \"twice\" after that. So \"run opposite left twice\" means the sequence of run opposite left is repeated twice. So that would be [two turns left, run] repeated twice. Wait, no: \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. Wait, rule 4 says \"verb twice = repeat the verb sequence twice\". So if the verb is modified by \"opposite left\", then \"run opposite left twice\" would be doing the entire opposite left run twice. Hmm, but how does that work? Let me clarify:\n\n\"run opposite left\" is first parsed as opposite left leading to two turns left then run. Then \"twice\" would repeat that entire sequence twice. So each time, two turns left and run, done twice. So that part would be I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN followed by I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN again.\n\nNow the other part of the command is \"look right twice\". Wait, \"look right\" isn't a primitive verb. The primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left/right. Hmm, but wait, the input here is \"look right twice\". But according to the rules, \"look right\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, the example uses \"jump around right\", which maps to turning right and jumping four times. So in the example, \"around right\" is 4 repetitions of [turn right + jump]. So \"jump around right\" becomes four times [turn right, jump], then the last turn right. Wait, in the example output, it's four turns and jumps, but the output ends with a turn right. Because the example's output is four times [turn right jump], then a final turn right. Wait, no. Let me check the example:\n\nIN: jump around right\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, that's four repetitions of [turn right + jump], followed by a final turn right. Wait, but according to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the example should have each repetition as turn right, jump. Then four times that, but the output shows four jumps. Wait, the example output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (x4), then I_TURN_RIGHT. So the four jumps are each preceded by a turn right, and then a final turn right. So total of 5 turns and 4 jumps? Hmm, maybe the rule is that \"around\" means turn in that direction, perform the verb, four times. Then turn again. Wait, but according to the rule, \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is turn DIR then verb. So four times. So in the example, four turns right and four jumps. But in the output, there are four jumps and five turns right. Because each repetition starts with a turn right, so the first jump is preceded by a turn, and then the fifth turn is after the last jump. Wait, but how? Let me think:\n\nThe example \"jump around right\" would be:\n\n[turn right, jump] x4, then turn right. But that's not clear. Wait, the output has:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (four times), then I_TURN_RIGHT. So each jump is followed by a turn, except the last one. Wait, no. Let's count the actions in the example:\n\nThe output is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times, then one more I_TURN_RIGHT. So total of 5 I_TURN_RIGHT and 4 I_JUMP.\n\nBut according to the rule, \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So each repetition is turn DIR followed by verb. So four times [turn right, jump], which would result in four turns and four jumps. But the example output has five turns. So perhaps the rule is that after the four repetitions, you turn again. Or maybe the example is incorrect, but according to the example, the output for around right is 4 verbs and 5 turns. Hmm, maybe the rule is not as written. Wait, the user's rules say:\n\n3. \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb].\n\nSo in the example, each repetition is [turn right, jump], so four times. That would be four turns and four jumps. But the example output shows:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWhich is four pairs of I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP, then an additional I_TURN_RIGHT. So total of five I_TURN_RIGHT and four I_JUMP. So that's 9 actions. Hmm, perhaps the rule should be that after each verb, you turn again. So for around right, you do turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, turn right, jump, then turn right. Wait, that would be five turns. But according to the rule, it's four repetitions of [turn + verb], which would be four turns and four verbs. So the example seems to contradict the rule. But perhaps the example is correct, and the rule's wording may need to be re-examined. Alternatively, maybe the example is a typo, but I have to work with what's given.\n\nIn any case, the current problem. Let's get back.\n\nThe input is \"run opposite left twice after look right twice\"\n\nBreaking down:\n\nThe entire command is structured as A after B, where A is \"run opposite left twice\" and B is \"look right twice\". According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So first, do \"look right twice\", then do \"run opposite left twice\".\n\nBut first, we need to parse \"look right twice\". Wait, \"look\" is not a primitive verb. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left/right. So \"look\" is not in the list. Hmm. This is a problem. Wait, the original problem says \"look right twice\" is part of the input. But according to the rules, only the primitive verbs are mapped. How do we handle non-primitive verbs?\n\nWait, the user's instruction says \"You are a semantic parsing agent for navigation commands.\" So maybe \"look right\" here is considered as a verb and direction. But according to the rules, only the primitive verbs are mapped. Unless \"look\" is a typo, but assuming the input is correct. Wait, this is a possible error. But perhaps \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\", but the problem is that the user's rule 1 lists the primitives as walk, run, jump, turn left/right. So \"look\" isn't a primitive. How to handle this?\n\nWait, perhaps \"look right twice\" is a command. But according to the rules, only the primitive verbs are mapped. So if \"look\" is not a primitive, then how to parse it? Maybe this is a mistake in the input, but perhaps the intended meaning is \"turn right\", but the user wrote \"look right\". Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\", but the problem is that the example uses \"look right\" but in the rules, the primitive is I_TURN_RIGHT. So perhaps \"look right\" here is a typo for \"turn right\". Alternatively, maybe the user intended \"look\" to be a verb, but according to the rules, \"look\" is not a primitive. Therefore, this might be an error. However, given that the input is as provided, I need to process it.\n\nWait, perhaps \"look right twice\" is supposed to be parsed as \"turn right twice\". Maybe a mistake in the input. Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn head right\", but according to the given rules, it's not part of the primitives. But according to the problem statement, the agent must process the command. So perhaps \"look right\" is being used as a verb that maps to a turn action. Wait, but according to rule 1, the only primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left/right. So \"look\" is not a primitive. Therefore, perhaps \"look right\" is invalid input, but the agent must handle it. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\". Maybe the user made a mistake in the input. Let's proceed under the assumption that \"look right\" should be \"turn right\", because otherwise, the command can't be processed. Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is a typo. But given that the input is as written, perhaps \"look right\" is intended to be parsed as \"turn right\". Let's proceed with that assumption, because otherwise, we can't parse it. So \"look right\" maps to I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is a new verb, but according to rule 1,", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 95, "model_reflection": "The interpretation of 'look right' as 'I_TURN_RIGHT' is a reasonable assumption since 'look right' is not a primitive verb and 'turn right' is the closest semantic match.

The input is \"look opposite right twice after look around left thrice\". Hmm, first, I need to parse each part according to the rules provided.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. But \"look\" isn't in the list of primitives given. The primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" might not correspond to any action. But maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps it's a typo. Wait, but the example uses \"jump around right\" which maps to turning and jumping. So perhaps \"look\" here is intended to be ignored, or maybe it's a trick. Wait, but the rules don't mention handling verbs that aren't primitives. The rules say \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\", but what if a verb isn't primitive? Hmm. Wait, looking back at the example, the input \"jump around right\" becomes I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times. So the verb is \"jump\", which is a primitive. But in the current problem, the input is \"look opposite right twice after look around left thrice\". So \"look\" isn't a primitive. Does that mean those parts are invalid? But according to the rules, maybe we should process them as if they are, even if they don't have a corresponding action. Or perhaps the problem assumes that all verbs are primitive. Wait, the user might have intended \"look\" to be a verb, but according to the given rules, only the listed ones are primitives. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, but the problem says \"semantic parsing agent for navigation commands\" so maybe only the listed actions are valid. However, the input might have non-primitive verbs, but how to handle them? The rules don't specify. But looking at the example, the output uses the uppercase actions as per the primitives. So perhaps any verb that's not in the list is invalid, but in the problem, we need to parse according to the rules, even if the verb isn't there. Wait, but the user might have intended \"look\" as a typo for \"walk\", or maybe \"look\" is supposed to be a different action. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a verb that isn't a primitive, which would mean that the problem is invalid. But the problem expects an answer, so maybe \"look\" here is a typo for \"walk\", or perhaps it's a mistake. But since the user provided the example, maybe we should proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is intended to be a verb. Wait, but according to the problem's rules, the primitive verbs are only those listed. Therefore, \"look\" is not a primitive verb. Therefore, the input may have an error, but the agent should still process it according to the rules. But how? Wait, perhaps the agent is supposed to ignore the verb if it's not a primitive. Or maybe the agent should process the structure regardless of the verb, even if the verb doesn't map to an action. Wait, but the example shows that the verb is converted to its uppercase action. So if the verb is not a primitive, what to do. Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to treat the verb as invalid, but since the problem is given, maybe the user intended \"look\" to be a typo for \"walk\". Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to test the parsing structure, regardless of the specific verb. But according to the rules, the primitive verbs must map to the specified actions. So \"look\" isn't a primitive, so perhaps the correct action would be to ignore it or indicate that there's an error, but the problem expects a sequence of actions. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a typo in the input, but since the user provided it as is, we have to work with it. Wait, but the rules don't mention handling non-primitive verbs, but the example shows that the verb is converted to its uppercase version. So perhaps the agent should convert the verb to uppercase regardless, even if it's not in the list. Wait, rule 1 says \"Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions: walk→I_WALK, run→I_RUN, etc.\" So only those verbs that are primitives get mapped. If the verb is not a primitive, like \"look\", then perhaps it doesn't map to any action. But the problem's example includes \"jump\", which is a primitive. Therefore, in the current input, \"look\" would not generate any action. But that would lead to a problem. However, the input structure is \"look opposite right twice after look around left thrice\". Let's parse the structure, even if the verbs are invalid. But the output should be the sequence of actions. So perhaps \"look\" would be treated as a verb, but since it's not a primitive, it would have no action. But according to the rules, the agent's job is to parse the structure and convert the verbs into their action sequences. So perhaps \"look\" would not be recognized, leading to invalid parts. But the problem expects an answer, so maybe \"look\" is a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the agent should process the structure regardless of the verb, using the verb's action if available, or skipping otherwise. But how to proceed. Maybe the problem is designed to test the structure, so even with invalid verbs, we can show the structure. Wait, but the example uses \"jump\" which is a primitive. So the correct approach is to parse the structure, and if the verb is not a primitive, then it would not produce any action. However, the problem's input uses \"look\" twice, which may not be a primitive. If that's the case, then the output would have no actions. But that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and \"look\" should be \"walk\" or \"jump\". But since we can't change the input, we have to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the agent is supposed to treat any verb as a primitive, even if it's not listed. Wait, the problem says \"primitive verbs\" so there are others, but the mapping is given. So \"look\" would be a non-primitive verb, and thus not allowed. But again, the problem is given, so perhaps we should proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a primitive verb. But according to the given rules, it's not. Hmm. This seems like a problem. Maybe the correct answer would be to ignore the \"look\" parts, but that would leave empty sequences. Alternatively, perhaps the agent should output the uppercase version regardless. For example, \"look\" becomes I_LOOK even if not in the primitives. But according to the rules, that's not stated. The rule says \"primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\", implying that non-primitives may not have a mapping. But the example shows that the input verb \"jump\" is mapped to I_JUMP. So perhaps any verb that's not in the list of primitives is treated as-is uppercase? Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is intended as a direction. No, because \"look\" is the verb here. The structure of the input is: look opposite right twice after look around left thrice. The \"after\" here means that \"twice\" part is done after the \"thrice\" part. Let's parse each part. Let's first split into the two parts connected by \"after\": \"look opposite right twice\" and \"look around left thrice\". According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So the order would be: execute the \"look around left thrice\" part first, then the \"look opposite right twice\" part. Now, each part needs to be processed. Let's take the first part: \"look around left thrice\". \"around left\" implies rule 3: 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. DIR is left. The verb here is \"look\". Then \"thrice\" means repeat the verb sequence three times. Wait, but \"around left\" is a single construct. So \"look around left thrice\" — wait, the structure is ambiguous. Wait, the phrasing \"look around left thrice\" — does \"around left\" modify \"look\", making a single verb phrase, then \"thrice\" applies to that? Or is \"look\" the verb, then \"around left\" is a modifier, then \"thrice\" applies to the entire verb plus modifier? According to the rules, \"A and B\", etc., but the grammar structure is that modifiers like \"around <DIR>\" apply to the verb. So \"look around left\" would be the verb phrase, then \"thrice\" applies. So the first part is \"look around left\" thrice. Wait, but rule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"thrice\" would repeat thrice. So \"look around left thrice\" would mean repeat the entire \"look around left\" three times. But \"around left\" would expand to a sequence. Let's parse \"look around left\": according to rule 3, this would be 4 repetitions of [turn left + verb]. The verb here is \"look\". So each iteration is turn left plus the verb. So expanding \"look around left\" would be: I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK repeated four times. Then, \"thrice\" would repeat that entire \"look around left\" sequence three times. Wait, but rule 4 says that \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, the rule says \"repeat the verb sequence twice; similarly for thrice\". Hmm. Wait, in the example \"jump around right\" is handled as the around rule. So the \"around\" applies to the verb. So perhaps \"look around left\" is", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 65, "model_reflection": "Upon re-evaluation, the original response incorrectly interpreted the 'look opposite right twice' clause. According to the rules, 'opposite right' should be interpreted as two turns right followed by the verb (look), i.e., I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK. Then 'twice' should repeat this entire sequence twice. The original response only repeated the two turns twice and omitted the actual 'look' action after each.

Wait, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs are only the ones listed: walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, how to handle this? Maybe \"look\" is a mistake, but since the user provided it, perhaps it's supposed to be treated as a non-primitive. Wait, but the rules don't mention handling unknown verbs. Hmm.

Wait, maybe \"look around right\" is equivalent to turning right and looking, but according to the rules, \"around right\" would be four repetitions of [turn right + verb].

Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a red herring, and the actual verb is \"run\" in the input. Wait, the input is \"look around right and run opposite left\". So the first part is \"look around right\", which might be invalid, but the second part is \"run opposite left\". So perhaps the first part is invalid, but the problem expects us to process it as per the rules. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" here is a typo for \"jump\". Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to treat \"look\" as a primitive verb. But according to the rules, only the ones listed are primitives. Therefore, the correct action would be to parse \"look around right\" as follows: around right is four repetitions of turn right plus the verb. The verb here is \"look\", which isn't a primitive. But the problem says to output the sequence of actions. Since \"look\" isn't a primitive, maybe it's ignored? Or perhaps it's an error, but since the user provided it, maybe we just map it to I_LOOK, even though it's not listed. The example uses I_JUMP, etc. Hmm. Wait, the problem says \"Only output the sequence of actions, with no punctuation.\" So if the verb isn't a primitive, perhaps we are supposed to ignore it, or maybe the problem expects that all verbs in the input are primitives. Since the example works with a primitive, but here \"look\" is a problem. Maybe the problem expects to treat \"look\" as a verb that doesn't map to any action. But according to rule 1, primitive verbs map to uppercase actions, which suggests that non-primitive verbs are invalid. But the problem doesn't specify handling invalid commands. So perhaps this is a test to see if I can handle it. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is supposed to be ignored. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that \"look\" is equivalent to turning in that direction, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and \"look\" should be \"walk\". But without further info, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that \"look\" is a valid primitive. But according to the rules, that's not. Hmm. Wait, maybe the problem is expecting us to proceed regardless. For example, if the input had \"look\", then the output would be actions like I_LOOK. But according to the example, the input \"jump\" becomes I_JUMP, which is a primitive. So perhaps \"look\" would map to I_LOOK. But the problem's rule 1 lists the known primitives. So unless there's a hidden mapping, perhaps \"look\" isn't a valid action. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, but I have to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps \"look around right\" is equivalent to turning right and looking, but according to the rules, \"around right\" would be four times [turn right and look]. But if \"look\" is not a movement command, then perhaps the action sequence would have I_TURN_RIGHT and I_LOOK, but since \"look\" isn't a primitive, that's an issue. Alternatively, perhaps the command is invalid, but the problem expects us to process it regardless. Maybe I should proceed assuming that \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\" or \"jump\", but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the verb must be a primitive, and \"look\" here is a mistake, but we can't process it, but given the example, maybe the correct approach is to replace \"look\" with a primitive. But since the user provided the input, I must process it as is. Hmm. This is a problem. Maybe the answer should ignore the \"look\" verb. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\", but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a mistake, and the correct input is \"jump around right\". But given the input, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that \"look\" is a primitive verb and map it to I_LOOK. Let's proceed with that. Because the problem's example uses \"jump\", which maps to I_JUMP, so following the same pattern, \"look\" would be I_LOOK. Even though it's not in the rules. The rules only list certain primitives, but maybe the rules are not exhaustive. Alternatively, maybe the rules are only specifying the mappings for those verbs, but others may exist. Hmm. Well, the problem says \"Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions\", which implies that other verbs would not be primitives. Therefore, \"look\" is not a primitive, so how would it be handled? Rule 1 says that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So if a verb is not primitive, does it map to something else? The rules don't specify. Therefore, if \"look\" is not a primitive, then according to the rules, the command \"look around right\" would not be parsed into any valid actions. But the problem gives this input, so perhaps the user expects that \"look\" is a primitive. Alternatively, maybe the problem's rule 1 is incomplete. Alternatively, perhaps this is a mistake. Let's proceed with the assumption that \"look\" is a typo for \"jump\", but I can't be sure. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use \"look\" as a verb that doesn't correspond to an action, which would mean that the first part of the command is invalid, but the second part is valid. But again, without further information, this is hard. Alternatively, perhaps \"look around right\" is a way to say turn right to look around, but according to the rules, \"around right\" would require the verb. Maybe the problem expects that the verb is \"turn right\", but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\". Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that \"look\" is treated as a verb, even if not listed. Let's proceed with that. So:\n\nFirst part: look around right. So \"around right\" means 4 times [turn right and look]. So the action sequence would be: I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK repeated four times, leading to:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK I_TURN_RIGHT I_LOOK.\n\nBut if \"look\" is not a primitive verb, then according to the rules, this may be invalid. However, the problem gives this input, so perhaps we proceed as such. Then the second part: run opposite left.\n\n\"opposite left\" means two turns left then run.

The input is \"walk right twice and run around left twice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part. Starting with \"walk right twice\". According to the rules, \"walk\" maps to I_WALK. Then \"right\" would be a turn right. Wait, but the structure here might be ambiguous. Wait, the phrase \"walk right twice\" – how to interpret that. Wait, the original example for \"jump around right\" became turning right and jumping four times. So maybe \"walk right\" is a turn right followed by walk. But then \"twice\" applies to that sequence. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's check the rules again. Rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" maps to two turns in DIR then the verb. Rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Rule 4: \"<verb> twice\" means repeat the verb sequence twice. Rule 5: \"A and B\" is A then B. Rule 6: \"A after B\" is B then A.\n\nNow, \"walk right twice\". The structure here is that \"right\" might be the direction for the verb. Wait, but \"walk right\" could be interpreted as turning right and then walking. But how? Let's think. The primitive verbs map to actions. So \"walk\" is I_WALK. But if there's a direction attached, like \"walk right\", how does that fit into the rules?\n\nWait, looking at the example given: \"jump around right\" becomes I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times. So \"around right\" is the modifier. So in the original example, \"around right\" means that you turn right and jump four times. So the direction after around is the direction to turn each time. So the structure is that modifiers like around, opposite, or directions might affect the sequence. \n\nBut how about \"walk right\"? The problem is that the rules don't explicitly mention turning in a direction followed by a verb unless there's a modifier like around or opposite. Let me re-examine the rules. Rule 1 says that primitive verbs map to the uppercase actions. So \"walk\" is I_WALK. But if the command is \"walk right\", then perhaps \"right\" is a direction, but according to the rules, unless there's a modifier like \"around\" or \"opposite\", maybe \"walk right\" is a turn right followed by a walk. Because otherwise, how would direction be used? Because the examples in the rules use \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" as separate verbs. Wait, rule 1 lists \"turn left→I_TURN_LEFT, turn right→I_TURN_RIGHT.\" So \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are their own verbs. So when the command says \"walk right\", is \"right\" a direction for the verb? For example, walking to the right direction. But according to the rules, the direction in the verb would be a turn first. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, in the example, \"jump around right\" is parsed as turning right each time before jumping. So the \"around right\" means that each time you turn right and then jump. So in that case, the direction modifies the verb by adding a turn. So perhaps in the case of \"walk right\", the \"right\" is a direction modifier, which would mean that you first turn right, then walk. But how does that fit with the rules? The rules don't mention that unless it's in the context of around, opposite, etc. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe \"walk right\" is equivalent to \"turn right then walk\", but the rules don't explicitly state that. The rules only mention that \"opposite <DIR>\" and \"around <DIR>\" have specific structures. So perhaps the \"right\" after a verb indicates a turn right followed by the verb.\n\nWait, in the example from the problem statement: the input \"jump around right\" becomes I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times. So \"around right\" means that each time you turn right and then do the verb. So perhaps the structure for \"walk right\" would be \"turn right and walk\", which according to rule 5 is \"A and B\" meaning A then B. But in that case, \"walk right\" would be equivalent to \"turn right and walk\", which would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK. However, how does the user express that? Because the rules don't state that a verb followed by a direction is equivalent to the turn plus the verb. Wait, but that's a possible interpretation here. Let me think.\n\nIf that's the case, then \"walk right\" would be \"turn right then walk\", so I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK. Then \"walk right twice\" would be repeating that sequence twice. According to rule 4, \"verb twice\" is repeat the verb sequence twice. So the \"verb\" here would be \"walk right\", which is I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK, and doing that twice. But wait, rule 4 says \"repeat the verb sequence twice\", so if the original sequence is turn and walk, then repeating it twice would be doing the pair twice.\n\nAlternatively, if \"walk right twice\" is parsed as \"walk (to the right) twice\", then perhaps it's just I_WALK twice. But according to the rules, how would direction be indicated? That's unclear. The rules don't mention directions modifying the verb unless in the context of around, opposite, etc.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is that a direction after a verb implies a turn in that direction followed by the verb. So \"walk right\" would be turn right then walk. This seems to be the way the example works. So the example \"jump around right\" uses turn right and jump each time. Similarly, \"jump opposite left\" would be two turns left then jump.\n\nSo assuming that a direction after a verb without a preposition (like \"around\", \"opposite\") would be equivalent to turning that direction then performing the verb. But the rules don't explicitly state this. But given the example, perhaps that's the correct approach.\n\nTherefore, \"walk right twice\" would be the sequence \"I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK\" repeated twice. Because \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. So according to rule 4, the entire verb sequence (turn and walk) is done twice.\n\nThen, the second part of the command is \"run around left twice\". Let's parse \"run around left twice\". The phrase \"around left\" is a modifier, so according to rule 3, that's four repetitions of [turn left + run]. So \"run around left\" would be I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN repeated four times. Then \"twice\" would multiply that entire sequence by two. Wait, no. Rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is four repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"run around left\" is four times [turn left and run]. Then \"run around left twice\" would be the entire \"around left\" sequence done twice? No, wait. Wait, rule 4 says: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if the verb sequence itself is \"run around left\", then \"run around left twice\" would be repeat that sequence twice. But \"run around left\" is already a four-fold repetition. However, perhaps the \"around left\" is a modifier of \"run\", so the \"run around left\" is the verb phrase. Then \"twice\" would apply to that verb phrase.\n\nBut wait, the command is \"run around left twice\". Let me parse this. The phrase \"run around left\" is the verb phrase, and \"twice\" applies to it. So \"run around left twice\" would be the same as repeating \"run around left\" twice. But according to rule 3, \"run around left\" is 4 repetitions of [turn left + run]. Therefore, \"run around left twice\" would be doing each of those four repetitions twice? No, perhaps not. Wait, rule 4 says that \"verb twice\" means repeat the verb sequence twice. So if the verb sequence is \"run around left\", then \"run around left twice\" would be doing the entire \"run around left\" sequence twice. But \"run around left\" itself is a compound action (four repetitions). Therefore, repeating that twice would be eight repetitions. But perhaps the \"around left\" is part of the verb, so \"run around left\" is a single verb phrase, and \"twice\" applies to that.\n\nBut according to the rules, \"around <DIR>\" is a modifier. So the structure is that \"run around left\" would be parsed as per rule 3. Then \"run around left twice\" would be repeating that entire \"run around left\" action (which is four turn left and run pairs) twice. Wait, no. Rule 4 says that \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"run around left\" is a verb phrase. So \"run around left twice\" would be doing the verb phrase twice. However, the verb phrase \"run around left\" already expands to four repetitions. Therefore, \"run around left twice\" would be expanding to (turn left, run) repeated four times, then again (turn left, run) repeated four times. But wait, no. The \"run around left\" is already four repetitions. So doing it twice would be 4 * 2 = 8 actions. But wait, no: each repetition of around is four [turn + verb]. So \"run around left\" is four [turn left and run], so \"run around left twice\" would be eight [turn left and run]?\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify.

The first rule says: Primitive verbs map to uppercase actions: walk→I_WALK, run→I_RUN, jump→I_JUMP, turn left→I_TURN_LEFT, turn right→I_TURN_RIGHT. So only these five are primitives. So \"look right\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, how to handle \"look right\"? Maybe \"look\" is a different command, but according to the rules, it's not listed. Hmm, but the problem expects me to process this input. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, maybe \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\"? Or maybe \"look right\" is not an action that the agent can perform. But that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe \"look right\" is a typo and should be \"turn right\". But since the user provided that input, I have to work with it.\n\nWait, but perhaps the user intended \"look right\" to be a verb, but according to the rules, it's not. Maybe the problem assumes that \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\"? Or maybe \"look\" is a different action that's not covered here. Since the problem must be solvable, perhaps there's an error in the input, but I have to proceed as per the rules given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look right\" is a verb that doesn't have a primitive action, but in the example, \"jump around right\" is handled. So if the input includes an invalid verb, how should I respond? But the problem says to process the command. Maybe the user intended \"look\" as a verb, but it's not in the rules. So perhaps this is a trick question, but maybe I should proceed under the assumption that \"look right\" is a valid verb. But that's conflicting with the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\". But that's an assumption. Alternatively, maybe \"look right\" is a separate action, but the rules don't list it. Hmm. This seems like a problem. But since the user provided the input, I must parse it. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe user says: \"look right twice and walk thrice\". According to the rules, \"walk\" is a verb. \"Look right\" is not a primitive verb. So perhaps \"look right\" is a noun phrase, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe \"look\" is a verb and \"right\" is a direction, but since it's not in the rules, how do I handle it?\n\nWait, the rules might imply that any verb not in the primitive list must be interpreted using the rules. But given that, perhaps \"look right\" is not a valid command, but the problem expects us to handle it. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the input, but we still have to process it. Alternatively, maybe \"look right\" is considered a verb phrase, but since the system doesn't recognize it, we can't process it. But the example uses \"jump around right\", which uses \"jump\" as a verb. So this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"look right\" here is a way of turning. For example, \"look right\" could mean \"turn right\", but that's an assumption. If that's the case, then \"look right twice\" would be equivalent to \"turn right twice\". But according to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR. So if the command is \"look right twice\", perhaps it's equivalent to turning right twice? But the problem is that the rules don't specify this. So this is an assumption.\n\nGiven that the problem expects an answer, perhaps we have to proceed under the assumption that \"look right\" maps to \"turn right\". Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is a different action, but since it's not in the primitives, we have to ignore it. But that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe \"look right\" is not a primitive verb, so it's not part of the allowed actions. Therefore, the command \"look right twice\" is invalid. But the problem is presented as a test case. Therefore, there must be a solution. Maybe the problem is designed to have \"look right\" parsed in some way. Let's think again.\n\nWait, the user input is \"look right twice and walk thrice\". Let's break it down. The command is \"A and B\", where A is \"look right twice\" and B is \"walk thrice\". According to rule 5: \"A and B\" means do A then B. Now, according to rule 4: \"twice\" means repeat the verb sequence twice. Similarly for \"thrice\". So \"look right twice\" would be repeating the verb sequence \"look right\" twice. But if \"look\" is not a primitive verb, then the verb here is \"look\", which is not in the list. But according to the problem's rules, the primitive verbs are only walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look right\" is a way of turning right. For example, \"turn right\" is equivalent to looking right. If that's the case, then \"look right\" could be equivalent to \"turn right\", then \"twice\" would mean repeating that action twice. But that's an assumption. So \"look right twice\" would be \"turn right\" twice. But then, according to rule 4, \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb], but that's not applicable here. Alternatively, \"twice\" just repeats the verb twice. So if \"look right\" is \"turn right\", then twice would be two turns right.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's consider that \"look right\" is a single verb. If \"look right\" was a primitive verb, then it would map to something like I_LOOK_RIGHT. But according to the rules, it's not listed. However, the problem might have a typo, and perhaps the intended command is \"turn right twice and walk thrice\". But since the input is \"look right\", we have to work with that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look right\" is a typo for \"turn right\". If that's the case, then we can proceed. Let's proceed under that assumption. Let's say \"look right\" is intended to be \"turn right\". Then \"look right twice\" would be \"turn right twice\", which would be two I_TURN_RIGHT actions. Then \"walk thrice\" would be three I_WALK actions.\n\nSo applying the rules:\n\n\"look right twice\" → \"turn right twice\" (assuming typo) → [I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT]\n\n\"walk thrice\" → repeat walk thrice → [I_WALK, I_WALK, I_WALK]\n\nThen \"A and B\" → A then B. So combining:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_WALK I_WALK\n\nBut this is under the assumption that \"look right\" was a mistake and should be \"turn right\". However, the problem's input is as given, and the user might have intended \"look right\" as a valid action. But according to the rules provided, this isn't the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look right\" is a different action. But since it's not in the primitive verbs, we can't do anything. But the problem expects an output, so perhaps the answer is that \"look right\" is not a valid command, but the problem seems to expect a different approach.\n\nWait another angle: Maybe \"look\" is a verb that's not a primitive, and \"right\" is a direction. But according to the rules, only the five primitives are allowed. Therefore, the agent can't perform any other verbs. But the input includes \"look right\", which is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn left\" or something else. But that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended that \"look right twice\" is equivalent to \"turn around\", which would be two left or right turns, but according to the rules,", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 60, "model_reflection": "The original interpretation of 'look right twice' as 'turn right twice' is speculative and violates the given rules, which only define mappings for primitive verbs like 'turn left' and 'turn right'.

The first part is \"look thrice\". According to the rules, \"twice\" and \"thrice\" mean repeating the verb sequence that many times. But wait, \"look\" isn't a primitive verb listed in the rules. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Hmm. Wait, the problem says I'm a semantic parsing agent for navigation commands, so maybe \"look\" isn't an action that's mapped. But the example given uses \"jump around right\" which maps to turning and jumping. However, in the user's input, there's a \"look thrice\". Since \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, does that mean it's ignored? Or maybe there's a typo and it should be \"walk\" or another verb. Alternatively, perhaps \"look\" is a command that's supposed to be handled, but according to the rules given, only the primitive verbs are mapped to actions. So maybe \"look\" doesn't correspond to any action. But the problem says to process the command according to the rules. So if \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, how to handle it?\n\nWait, looking back at the rules: Rule 1 says primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So only the verbs listed (walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right) are primitives. \"look\" is not among them. Therefore, perhaps \"look thrice\" is a command that can't be processed, but maybe the user intended it as a typo? Or perhaps \"look\" is a verb that's allowed in the language but not a primitive. However, the instructions don't mention other verbs. So this is a problem.\n\nWait, the example input uses \"jump around right\" which translates to turning right and jumping four times. So the primitive verbs are the ones listed, but other verbs might be used in the input. Wait, no. The rules specify how to process the input. So if \"look\" is not a primitive verb, then perhaps the parser should ignore it or leave it as is. But according to the problem statement, the agent is supposed to output the sequence of actions based on the rules. So if \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, then the parser can't convert it into an action. However, the user might have made a mistake. But the agent's job is to parse according to the rules. Therefore, \"look\" isn't a valid action, so perhaps it's skipped? Or maybe the problem expects that \"look\" is not part of the actions. Wait, but the example input uses \"jump\", which is a primitive, so that's converted to I_JUMP. So in this case, \"look\" isn't a primitive. Therefore, how to handle it?\n\nWait, perhaps the input command has a mistake, but the problem expects us to parse according to the rules. Therefore, if \"look\" isn't a primitive verb, then \"look thrice\" would not generate any action. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that \"look\" is a typo for \"walk\"? Let me check the original command again: \"look thrice and walk right twice\". So the user says \"look thrice and walk right twice\". The first part is \"look thrice\", which would be invalid. Hmm. But since the problem is presented as a test, perhaps there's a trick here. Let me re-examine the problem rules.\n\nWait, the rules mention that \"A and B\" = do A then B. So \"look thrice and walk right twice\" is equivalent to doing \"look thrice\" then \"walk right twice\". But \"look\" isn't a primitive verb. So perhaps the first part is ignored? That seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe \"walk right\" is a turn and a walk. Wait, \"walk right\" might be parsed as \"turn right then walk\" because of rule 2 or 3. Wait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR then the verb. Rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions. But \"walk right\" isn't using \"opposite\" or \"around\". So \"walk right\" would be the verb \"walk\" modified by the direction \"right\"? Wait, but according to the rules, how is direction handled? The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are their own actions. But \"walk right\" would be a direction. Wait, perhaps \"walk right\" is equivalent to turn right then walk. Or maybe \"walk right\" is a different action. Wait, but according to the rules given, there's no mention of direction in the walk/run/jump. The example input is \"jump around right\", which uses the \"around\" rule. So perhaps \"walk right\" would be interpreted as \"turn right then walk\", but according to which rule? Let me check.\n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" → two turns in DIR then the verb. So if it's \"opposite right\", that would be two right turns (i.e., turn right twice, which would face the opposite direction), then the verb.\n\nRule 3: \"around <DIR>\" → 4 repetitions of turn DIR plus verb.\n\nSo \"walk right\" isn't using those. So maybe \"walk right\" is not a valid construction. Unless \"right\" is an argument to the walk command, but according to the rules, the primitive verbs don't have direction unless specified via the turn commands. Therefore, perhaps \"walk right\" is parsed as \"turn right\" followed by \"walk\", but according to which rule?\n\nWait, the original problem's example input is \"jump around right\", which is parsed as four times (turn right + jump). So \"around right\" applies to the jump verb. So \"around <DIR>\" modifies the verb to do the pattern four times. Similarly, if someone says \"walk right\", unless there's a rule that specifies that a direction after a verb means turning first, then walking. But the rules don't mention that. Therefore, perhaps directions after the verb are handled via the \"opposite\" or \"around\" rules. Otherwise, if the input is \"walk right\", that might be invalid. But \"walk\" is a primitive verb. So how to parse \"walk right\"? Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the rules again. Rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" becomes two turns in DIR then the verb. So the structure is \"opposite <DIR> <verb>\". So \"walk opposite right\" would be two right turns (to face opposite direction) then walk. Similarly, rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" → 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"jump around right\" is parsed as four times [turn right, jump].\n\nSo in the input \"walk right twice\", the \"right\" isn't part of \"opposite\" or \"around\". The input is \"walk right twice\". Wait, the user's command is \"look thrice and walk right twice\".\n\nSo breaking down \"walk right twice\". The \"twice\" applies to the entire verb sequence. So \"walk right\" is the verb sequence to be repeated twice. But \"walk right\" is not a primitive. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps \"walk right\" is equivalent to \"turn right then walk\", but under which rule? There's no rule that says that. Unless \"right\" is a direction here and the parser is supposed to infer that walking in a direction requires turning first. But according to the given rules, there's nothing that covers that. The only rules are 1-6, and directions are handled in \"opposite\" and \"around\". So unless \"walk right\" is equivalent to \"turn right and walk\", which would be according to rule 5 (A and B = do A then B). So \"walk right\" could be parsed as \"turn right and walk\", which would be \"I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK\". Then \"walk right twice\" would be doing that twice. Let's try that.\n\nSo \"walk right\" would be \"turn right and walk\", which per rule 5, is \"I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK\". Then \"twice\" would repeat that entire sequence twice. So \"walk right twice\" becomes [I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK] repeated twice, so \"I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK\".\n\nBut wait, according to rule 4: \"A twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"walk right twice\" would mean that \"walk right\" is the verb sequence to be repeated. But if \"walk right\" itself is a composite action (like turn right then walk), then repeating that twice would be the same as doing that composite action two times.\n\nBut how to parse \"walk right\" if there's no rule that directly applies. Unless \"walk right\" is considered a single primitive verb, but according to rule 1, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"walk right\" is a separate primitive verb? No, because the primitives are \"walk\", \"turn left\", \"turn right\", etc. So \"walk right\" would not be a primitive verb. So how to parse this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"walk right\" is a mistake, and the user intended \"turn right then walk\". But according to the rules, we need to parse based on the given command.\n\nWait, perhaps the input \"walk right\" is a verb phrase where the direction is modifying the walk action. But according to the rules, direction modifiers are only handled via \"opposite\" and \"around\". So maybe \"walk right\" is not a valid command.

The input is \"look around left and look opposite left twice\". \n\nFirst, I need to handle \"look around left\". According to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" means 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the direction is left and the verb is look. So for each of the four times, I turn left then look. But wait, the primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. However, \"look\" isn't in the list. Hmm, the rules say primitive verbs map to actions like I_WALK, etc. But \"look\" isn't listed. Maybe the actual action for \"look\" is I_LOOK? Since the example uses jump which becomes I_JUMP, this should be similar. So assuming \"look\" maps to I_LOOK.\n\nSo \"look around left\" would be: turn left then look, repeated four times. So each cycle is I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK. Four times would be four cycles: I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK.\n\nNext part: \"look opposite left twice\".

The input is \"turn right thrice after jump opposite left twice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the structure. The main components here are \"turn right thrice\" and \"jump opposite left twice\", connected by \"after\". According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So the order will be to first execute the \"jump opposite left twice\" part, then the \"turn right thrice\" part.\n\nStarting with \"jump opposite left twice\". Let's parse this. \"opposite left\" (rule 2) means two turns in the left direction followed by the verb. So opposite left would be two left turns, then jump. Wait, no. Wait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. Wait, so \"jump opposite left\" would mean: first do two turns left (since DIR is left), then jump. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the phrase is \"jump opposite left twice\". Wait, the original command is \"jump opposite left twice\". Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the input is \"jump opposite left twice\". So \"jump opposite left\" modified by \"twice\". Hmm. Wait, the structure is \"jump opposite left twice\". Let's parse the modifiers first. So \"opposite left\" is a direction modifier for \"jump\", and then \"twice\" applies to the entire action. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe phrase is \"jump opposite left twice\". The \"opposite left\" would be a direction modifier for the jump, and \"twice\" would mean repeating that entire action twice. So according to rule 2, \"opposite left\" becomes two left turns, then jump. But wait, the verb here is \"jump opposite left\", so the opposite left modifies the jump. So the jump is preceded by two left turns. Then \"twice\" (rule 4) says \"verb twice\" is repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"jump opposite left twice\" would be the sequence [two left turns, jump] repeated twice. So that's:\n\nFirst iteration: I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nSecond iteration: I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nSo that's two times the sequence of two left turns and a jump. Wait, no. Wait, the \"twice\" applies to the entire \"jump opposite left\" action. So according to rule 4, \"A twice\" is repeat the verb sequence twice. So the \"jump opposite left\" is one verb sequence. So \"jump opposite left\" once would be two left turns, then jump. Then \"twice\" would mean repeating that entire sequence twice. So each time, you do two left turns, jump, then again two left turns, jump. Wait, no. Wait, no, \"opposite left\" is two left turns, then jump. So the entire action is \"turn left twice then jump\", and \"twice\" would mean doing that entire sequence twice. Wait, but \"jump opposite left\" is the verb. So \"jump opposite left\" once would be two left turns, then jump. Then doing that twice. So each time, two left turns, jump. Then again two left turns, jump. So each repetition is two turns left and a jump. So the sequence would be:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nWait, but the \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. Wait, rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So the verb here is \"jump opposite left\", which is parsed as two left turns followed by the jump. So repeating that twice would be the same as doing that entire sequence twice. So that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the \"turn right thrice\" part. \"thrice\" means three times. So \"turn right\" thrice would be I_TURN_RIGHT repeated three times. Wait, but \"turn right\" is the primitive verb. So \"turn right thrice\" would be the action I_TURN_RIGHT done three times. So the sequence is I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT.\n\nBut according to the rule 6, \"A after B\" is B then A. So the entire command is \"turn right thrice after jump opposite left twice\". So we need to execute B (jump opposite left twice) first, then A (turn right thrice). Therefore, the full sequence would be:\n\nFirst, \"jump opposite left twice\" → two left turns + jump, repeated twice. Then \"turn right thrice\" → three right turns.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFirst part: [I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP] repeated twice.\n\nSo first iteration: I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nSecond iteration: I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nSo the first part is:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP\n\nThen the second part is \"turn right thrice\" → I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nSo the entire sequence is:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, the input is \"turn right thrice after jump opposite left twice\". So according to rule 6, \"A after B\" means B then A. So A is \"turn right thrice\", B is \"jump opposite left twice\". So the output is B followed by A.\n\nYes. So B is \"jump opposite left twice\" which becomes two times [two left turns, jump], and A is \"turn right thrice\" which is three right turns.\n\nSo combining them, the output is:\n\nI_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT\n\nWait, but the example uses underscores in the actions.

The input is \"jump around right thrice and walk around left\". I need to break this down using the rules provided.\n\nFirst, I'll split the command into parts: \"jump around right thrice\" and \"walk around left\", connected by \"and\". According to rule 5, \"A and B\" means do A then B in order. So I'll process each part separately and then combine them.\n\nStarting with \"jump around right thrice\". Let's parse \"jump around right\" first. Rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Here, the verb is jump and direction is right. So each repetition is I_TURN_RIGHT followed by I_JUMP. Since it's \"around right\", that's four times. But wait, the example for \"jump around right\" gave four turns and four jumps. Let me check the example again. The example input was \"jump around right\" and the output was four I_TURN_RIGHT and four I_JUMP alternately. So yes, each around DIR is four times [turn DIR + verb]. So \"jump around right\" would be [I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP] repeated four times.\n\nBut then the original part here is \"jump around right thrice\". The \"thrice\" applies to the entire \"jump around right\" sequence. Rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice, similarly for thrice. Wait, rule 4: does \"thrice\" apply to the verb or the entire structure? Let's re-read rule 4. Rule 4 says that \"<verb> twice\" means repeat the verb sequence twice. So if it's \"jump around right thrice\", the entire \"jump around right\" sequence is repeated thrice. Wait, but \"jump around right\" itself is a verb sequence. So \"jump around right thrice\" would be the entire around sequence repeated three times. Wait, but \"around\" is part of the verb structure here. Hmm. Wait, no. Let me parse this.\n\nOriginal command: \"jump around right thrice\". Breaking down with the rules. The phrase \"jump around right\" is parsed as per rule 3. Then \"thrice\" would apply to that entire action. Rule 4 says that \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"verb\" here refers to the primitive verb modified by around, opposite, etc. Or does \"around\" form a compound verb? Maybe \"jump around right\" is a single action sequence. Then \"thrice\" would make that entire sequence happen three times. Wait, but rule 4's examples would be like \"walk twice\" meaning walk twice. If \"jump around right\" is considered a verb phrase, then \"thrice\" would apply to that entire phrase. So \"jump around right thrice\" would be equivalent to repeating the entire \"jump around right\" three times.\n\nBut wait, the example in the rules shows that \"jump around right\" becomes four repetitions. So if we have \"jump around right thrice\", does that multiply by 3? Or wait, perhaps \"jump around right\" is a single action (but according to the example, it's expanded as four turns and jumps). So the \"around\" is a modifier that expands to the sequence. Then \"thrice\" would modify the entire \"jump around right\" structure. Wait, maybe not. Let's re-examine the rules.\n\nRule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"verb\" here includes any modifiers. For example, if the verb is \"jump around right\", then \"jump around right twice\" would be that entire sequence repeated twice. So yes, the \"around\" is part of the verb structure. So \"jump around right thrice\" would be the same as the \"around right\" sequence multiplied by 3 times. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, \"around\" is a modifier that creates a longer sequence. Then \"jump around right\" becomes a certain sequence of actions. Then \"jump around right thrice\" would repeat that entire sequence three times. So first process \"jump around right\" as per rule 3, which expands into four [turn right + jump] pairs, then repeat that entire expansion three times. Hmm, but that would lead to 4 * 3 repetitions of the turn and jump. Wait, but that's possible. Let's think.\n\nWait, if \"jump around right\" expands to [I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP] four times. Then \"jump around right thrice\" would be that same sequence repeated three times. So total of 4 * 3 = 12 actions? Or wait, no. Wait, no: the \"around\" already expands to four repetitions. So \"jump around right\" is four times [turn right then jump]. Then \"jump around right thrice\" would be repeating that entire block three times. So the entire \"jump around right\" block is done three times. Which would make sense. So the expansion would be:\n\nFirst \"jump around right\" thrice:\n\nEach \"jump around right\" is [I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP] *4. Then thrice would repeat that entire block three times. But wait, according to rule 4, \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. The verb here is \"jump\", modified by \"around right\". So when you say \"jump around right thrice\", the entire verb sequence (which is expanded as per rules) is repeated three times. So each repetition of the verb would be \"jump around right\", which itself is four steps. So the total would be three times the entire \"jump around right\" sequence.\n\nBut wait, but that would mean that each \"jump around right\" is four turns and jumps, so thrice would make three times that. So:\n\n[jump around right] [jump around right] [jump around right]\n\nEach of these would be four [turn right + jump] steps. So each block would expand to four [turn right, jump], and then thrice would make three such blocks.\n\nWait, but how does rule 4 work? Let's re-read:\n\nRule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice; similarly for thrice.\n\nAh, so the verb is mapped to its action sequence, and then that sequence is repeated twice. So if the verb phrase is \"jump around right\", which expands to a sequence S, then \"jump around right twice\" would be S followed by S.\n\nSo in this case, \"jump around right\" expands to S = [I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP] repeated four times. Then \"jump around right thrice\" would be S followed by S followed by S. So S repeated three times.\n\nSimilarly, \"walk around left\" would expand to a sequence T (four repetitions of [turn left + walk]). Then \"jump around right thrice and walk around left\" would be S repeated thrice followed by T.\n\nWait, but wait, the original input is \"jump around right thrice and walk around left\". So the first part is \"jump around right thrice\", which is S * 3, then the second part is \"walk around left\", which is T (S' *4 where S' is [turn left + walk]).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nS = [I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP] *4 (from jump around right)\nBut since it's thrice, we have S repeated thrice. Then walk around left expands to [I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK] *4.\n\nBut wait, no: \"jump around right\" is a verb phrase. The expansion of that phrase is S = I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP (four turns and four jumps). Then \"jump around right thrice\" would be S repeated three times.\n\nThen \"walk around left\" would expand to [I_TURN_LEFT I_WALK] repeated four times.\n\nAnd \"A and B\" means do A then B, so the entire sequence would be S (jump around right) three times, then T (walk around left once).\n\nWait, but wait: \"jump around right thrice\" is S repeated three times. So the entire command becomes:\n\n[S] *3 + [T]\n\nBut S itself is four [turn right + jump] pairs. So each S is four actions. Then three S's would be 12 actions, followed by T which is four actions.\n\nWait, but wait, the example input \"jump around right\" gives an output of four turns and four jumps alternately. So S is the four [turn and jump], so each \"jump around right\" is four pairs. Then \"jump around right thrice\" would be that sequence multiplied by three? Or wait, according to rule 4, \"jump around right\" is a verb phrase, so repeating the verb's action sequence thrice.\n\nYes. So the verb is \"jump around right\" (but according to the rules, \"around\" modifies the verb, expanding into the sequence). The \"thrice\" applies to the entire verb sequence. So the entire \"jump around right\" expands to S, then \"jump around right thrice\" would be S repeated three times. So yes, S three times.\n\nSimilarly, the second part \"walk around left\" would expand to T once.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFirst part S *3: each S is [I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP] repeated four times. So each S is:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nThen three times that S would be:\n\n[ I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP ] *4 repeated three times.\n\nWait, but that's a lot of actions. Let me count.\n\nEach \"jump around right\" (S) is four turns right and four jumps.

The input is \"turn around right after jump opposite right twice\". Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me break it down according to the rules provided.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the command into its components. The key here is understanding the structure and the order dictated by the rules. Let's start by identifying each part.\n\nThe phrase is \"turn around right after jump opposite right twice\". Let's split it into parts. The \"after\" here means we should process the part after \"after\" first. So according to rule 6: \"A after B\" = B then A. So \"turn around right after jump opposite right twice\" translates to doing \"jump opposite right twice\" first, then \"turn around right\" after that.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the entire command is \"turn around right after jump opposite right twice\". So the main structure is \"A after B\", where A is \"turn around right\" and B is \"jump opposite right twice\". Therefore, the order should be B followed by A.\n\nBut let's parse each component step by step.\n\nStarting with B: \"jump opposite right twice\". Let's break this down. The \"opposite right\" part refers to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" equals two turns in DIR direction then the verb. So opposite right would be two right turns (I_TURN_RIGHT, I_TURN_RIGHT) followed by the verb, which is jump (I_JUMP). But since this is followed by \"twice\", we have to repeat the entire sequence twice. Wait, no: rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb], but rule 3 says \"A twice\" is repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, rule 4 is for \"around\", rule 3 says \"A twice\" is repeat the verb twice. So \"jump opposite right twice\" would mean that the entire \"jump opposite right\" is repeated twice. But wait, \"jump opposite right\" is a single action. Wait, perhaps \"jump opposite right\" is a single command. Let's parse \"jump opposite right\".\n\n\"jump opposite right\" would be the verb \"jump\" combined with \"opposite right\". According to rule 2, \"opposite right\" means two right turns, so I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT. Then the verb, which is jump: I_JUMP. So \"jump opposite right\" is the sequence I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP. Then \"twice\" means this entire sequence is repeated twice. So \"jump opposite right twice\" becomes:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nWait, no. Wait, rule 4: \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. But rule 3: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. Wait, maybe \"twice\" applies to the verb part. Hmm. Wait, in this case, \"jump opposite right twice\" could be ambiguous. Let me re-examine the structure.\n\nThe phrase is \"jump opposite right twice\". The \"twice\" is a modifier. Let's parse it. The main verb is \"jump\". The modifiers are \"opposite right\" and \"twice\". According to the rules, \"opposite right\" is two turns right then the verb. Then \"twice\" would apply to the entire verb sequence modified by opposite right. Wait, but rule 3 says \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So perhaps \"jump opposite right twice\" would be equivalent to doing the \"jump opposite right\" action twice. But how is \"jump opposite right\" structured?\n\nBreaking down \"jump opposite right\": the verb is \"jump\", modified by \"opposite right\". So according to rule 2, the \"opposite right\" becomes two right turns, then the verb. So the sequence would be two right turns, then jump. So \"jump opposite right\" is I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP.\n\nThen adding \"twice\" would repeat that entire sequence twice. So \"jump opposite right twice\" would be:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP\n\nYes, that makes sense. So B part (jump opposite right twice) is that sequence.\n\nNow the A part is \"turn around right\". According to rule 3, \"around right\" means 4 repetitions of [turn right + verb]. Here, the verb is \"turn\", but wait, the original command is \"turn around right\". Wait, wait: \"turn around right\" is a single command. Let's parse this. \"around right\" is the modifier. So the verb is \"turn\" (I_TURN_RIGHT in this case?), but wait, the primitive verbs are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\", which map to I_TURN_LEFT and I_TURN_RIGHT. So \"turn around right\" would be the verb \"turn\" (but the primitive is \"turn left\" or \"turn right\"). Wait, the command here is \"turn around right\", so the main verb is \"turn\" in the direction modified by \"around right\".\n\nWait, according to rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"turn around right\" would be \"around right\" modifying the verb \"turn\". Wait, but the verb here is \"turn\", but according to the primitives, \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are their own verbs. Hmm, this might be a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, the original command in part A is \"turn around right\". So the structure is the verb \"turn\" followed by \"around right\". So according to rule 3, \"around right\" would mean that the verb is done four times, each preceded by a turn right. Wait, rule 3 says: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the entire \"around <DIR>\" is a modifier on the verb. So \"turn around right\" would be interpreted as the verb \"turn\" (but \"turn\" alone isn't a primitive verb; the primitives are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\"). Wait, this is a problem. Wait, according to rule 1, the primitive verbs are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\", which map to I_TURN_LEFT and I_TURN_RIGHT. So \"turn\" alone isn't a primitive. So perhaps \"turn around right\" is parsed as follows.\n\nWait, the original command is \"turn around right\". So maybe \"around right\" modifies the verb \"turn\", but what's the intended action here? Because \"around\" would mean that you turn in a direction and do the verb four times, but the verb here is \"turn\" which direction?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"turn around right\" is not a primitive command. Wait, maybe the correct parsing is that \"around right\" modifies the verb \"turn right\"? Let me think again.\n\nWait, \"turn around right\" could be ambiguous. Let's re-express this. The rule says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the verb here is the original verb. So if the command is \"X around right\", then X is the verb. So in this case, the command part is \"turn around right\", so the verb X is \"turn\" in some direction? But according to the primitive verbs, \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are separate. So perhaps \"turn around right\" is a command where the verb is \"turn right\", modified by \"around right\". Wait, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps the verb here is \"turn right\", and \"around right\" would modify it. But according to rule 3, the \"around\" applies to the verb. Hmm. Let's parse \"turn around right\" as \"turn (around right)\". The verb is \"turn\", but modified by \"around right\". But since the primitives are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\", maybe this is not a valid command. Alternatively, perhaps \"turn around right\" is a way to turn right four times, but that would be a full circle. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, perhaps the intended parsing is that \"around right\" applies to the verb \"turn right\", but that seems unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps \"turn around right\" is equivalent to \"walk around right\" but with the verb \"turn right\". Wait, but this is confusing. Let's try to think of an example. Let's say the command was \"walk around right\". Then according to rule 3, it would be 4 repetitions of [turn right, walk], so:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK I_TURN_RIGHT I_WALK\n\nBut in our case, the command is \"turn around right\". So the verb would be \"turn right\" (since that's a primitive verb). Then \"around right\" would imply that we do [turn right + verb] four times. But the verb here is \"turn right\". Wait, that would be:\n\nEach repetition is [turn right, turn right], done four times. So each step would be I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT, done four times. So overall:\n\nI_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT (x4)\n\nWait, but that would be eight actions. Hmm. Let me re-express this:\n\nOriginal command: turn around right.\n\nRule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]\n\nHere, the verb is \"turn\" modified by \"around right\". But the primitive verbs are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". So the verb here would be \"turn right\" (since the command is \"turn around right\", but the \"around\" is modifying the verb. Wait, perhaps the original verb is \"turn right\", but no", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Not reasonable", "confidence_score": 60, "model_reflection": "The original parsing misinterprets the phrase 'turn around right' by treating 'turn' as implying 'I_TURN_RIGHT', which is incorrect under the rules.

According to the primitive verbs, \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are separate actions. So \"walk right\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, \"walk\" is a primitive verb (I_WALK), and \"right\" would be part of a direction modifier. But wait, the rules don't mention direction modifiers except in the cases specified. Hmm. Wait, perhaps \"walk right\" is a misinterpretation. Wait, maybe it's \"walk after right thrice\"? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-express the input.\n\nThe input is \"walk thrice after walk right thrice\". Let's parse this.\n\nFirst, \"walk right thrice\". How to parse \"walk right\"? Since \"walk\" is a primitive verb, and \"right\" alone isn't a primitive verb. But according to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" would be two turns. Rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" would be a pattern. But here, \"walk\" is followed by \"right\". Maybe \"right\" here is part of a direction modifier for the walk? Or is there a missing turn? Or perhaps the user intended \"walk\" and then \"turn right\" thrice?\n\nWait, but the rules don't specify that \"walk right\" would be a combination. Alternatively, maybe there's a missing \"turn\"? Like, \"turn right\" thrice. But the input is \"walk right thrice\". Hmm. Let's check the original problem again. The example input was \"jump around right\" which becomes four turns and jumps. So perhaps \"walk right\" here is not a standard construction. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, but we have to work with the given input.\n\nWait, perhaps \"walk right\" is a typo, but according to the problem statement, we need to parse it according to the rules. Let's re-examine the rules. The rules only define mappings for the primitive verbs. So \"walk\" is a verb, and \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are verbs. So \"right\" by itself isn't an action. So \"walk right\" may not be a primitive verb. Therefore, perhaps \"walk right\" is a combination where \"right\" is a direction, and the rule applies in some way. Wait, but the rules don't mention direction modifiers except in the specific cases of \"opposite\", \"around\", etc.\n\nWait, maybe \"walk right\" is intended as a single action, but according to the rules, only the primitives are mapped. Therefore, perhaps \"walk right\" is invalid, but given that the user provided it, we need to parse it. Maybe it's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps \"walk\" followed by \"right\" as a direction. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"walk right\" is a misstatement, and it should be \"turn right\" followed by walk. But without further information, we have to parse according to the given input.\n\nWait, perhaps \"walk right\" is a verb followed by a direction. Let's consider the command \"walk right thrice\". According to the rules, if \"right\" is a direction, maybe \"walk\" in the right direction. But the rules don't specify that. The rules only handle \"around <DIR>\" and \"opposite <DIR>\". So perhaps \"walk right\" is just \"I_WALK\" followed by \"I_TURN_RIGHT\"? No, that's not supported by the rules. Hmm. This is a problem. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps \"walk right\" is a misunderstanding. Let's look at the example again. The example input was \"jump around right\", which maps to four turns and jumps. So \"around right\" is a modifier. But \"walk right\" here isn't \"around right\" or \"opposite right\", so maybe \"walk\" and \"right\" are separate. But \"right\" isn't a verb. Therefore, perhaps \"walk right\" is invalid, but given that the user provided it, we need to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps \"walk right\" is a typo for \"turn right\". But that's an assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended \"walk\" and then \"turn right\", but the command structure isn't clear. Wait, but according to the rules, if a command is not covered, perhaps we need to parse \"right\" as a direction modifier. Alternatively, perhaps \"walk right\" is a mistake and should be \"turn right\", but again, that's assuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"walk right thrice\" is \"walk\" followed by \"right thrice\", but \"right\" isn't a primitive verb. So that's invalid. Therefore, perhaps the input is incorrect. But the user wants us to process it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended \"walk right\" as a compound action. If that's the case, but according to the rules, there's no mapping for that. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps \"walk right\" here is a misstatement and should be \"turn right\". If that's the case, then \"walk right thrice\" would be \"turn right\" thrice, but that's not part of the input. Alternatively, maybe \"walk\" is a verb, and \"right\" is a direction, and \"walk right\" means to walk in the right direction. But according to the given rules, how to parse that?\n\nThis is a problem. Let's see. The user's input is \"walk right thrice\". Let's parse it as \"walk\" modified by \"right\", which according to the rules. The rules don't mention walking in directions, but perhaps \"right\" here is a direction, and the action would be \"walk forward\", but that's not covered. Since the rules don't specify any mapping for direction modifiers to primitive verbs (except in the cases of around/opposite), perhaps \"walk right\" is invalid. However, given that the problem expects us to process it, maybe we should treat \"walk right\" as a single action, but according to the first rule, the primitive verbs are only walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"walk right\" isn't in the primitive verbs. Therefore, perhaps \"walk\" and \"right\" are separate, but \"right\" isn't a verb. Therefore, this is invalid. But since the user provided it, perhaps we have to proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps the input is \"walk after right thrice\", but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe \"walk right\" is a typo for \"turn right\". But again, that's assuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"walk right\" should be interpreted as \"walk\" in the \"right\" direction, which might require a turn first. But according to rule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" would be two turns. But that's not applicable here. Or maybe, \"walk right\" is equivalent to turning right and then walking? But that's not a rule here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input is \"walk right\" meaning \"walk around right\", but the user omitted \"around\". Not sure.\n\nWait, given that the example input was \"jump around right\", which expands to four turns and jumps. Maybe \"walk right\" is supposed to be \"walk around right\"? But that's not what the user wrote.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended \"walk right\" as a single verb, but according to the rules, it's not. Therefore, perhaps the input is invalid, but the user expects us to proceed. Hmm. Since the problem is presented as-is, maybe there's a different approach.\n\nLet's re-express the command: \"walk thrice after walk right thrice\". According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means B then A.

So \"around right\" would apply to the verb. Wait, the structure is \"turn around right\", so \"around right\" is the direction. Hmm.\n\nWait, rule 3 says that \"around <DIR>\" equals 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Wait, the verb here is \"turn\". Wait, no. Wait, the example in the rules was \"jump around right\" becomes four turns right and jumps. So the verb is \"jump\". So in \"turn around right\", the verb is \"turn\"? That doesn't make sense because \"turn around right\" would mean applying the around rule to \"turn\". Wait, no, \"turn around right\" might not be a primitive verb. Wait, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn around right\" is a command that uses the \"turn\" verb but modified by \"around right\". Wait, no. Let's re-examine the rules.\n\nRule 1 says that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are primitive verbs. So \"turn around right\" is a different command. The structure of the command is \"turn around right twice and run left\". Hmm. Wait, the original input is \"turn around right twice and run left\". So first part is \"turn around right twice\", second part is \"run left\". \n\nSo \"turn around right\" is the first action. According to rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Wait, the verb here is \"turn\"? Because the command is \"turn around right\". Wait, the verb here would be \"turn\", so \"around right\" would mean that each repetition in the around sequence would be \"turn right\" followed by the verb. Wait, no, that's confusing. Wait, the rule says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So the entire \"around <DIR>\" applies to a verb. For example, \"jump around right\" would be four times [turn right, jump]. So the verb is \"jump\".\n\nSo in \"turn around right\", the verb here is \"turn\". But \"turn\" isn't a primitive verb; the primitives are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". Hmm, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Wait, the problem states that the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn\" alone isn't a primitive verb. So \"turn around right\" might be parsed as \"around right\" modifying \"turn left\" or \"turn right\"? No, that's unclear. Wait, the command is \"turn around right\", which isn't a primitive. Wait, perhaps the verb here is \"turn\" (but the primitives are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\"). This is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe \"turn around right\" is parsed as \"around right\" applied to the verb \"turn left\"? No. Alternatively, perhaps \"turn around right\" is a way to say \"turn right twice\" because \"opposite\" would be two turns, but \"around\" would be four times. Wait, rule 3 says \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. Wait, maybe the verb here is \"turn\", but that's not a primitive. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the command \"turn around right\" is invalid, but given that the user provided this input, we need to parse it. Let me think again. The original example was \"jump around right\", which becomes four times [turn right, jump]. So the verb here is \"jump\", and the \"around right\" tells you to do [turn right + verb] four times. So \"turn around right\" would be a similar structure, where the verb is \"turn\". Wait, but \"turn\" isn't a primitive. Unless the verb is \"turn left\" or \"turn right\", but the \"around\" would modify it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the command is \"turn around right\" where \"around right\" is the direction, but that's not in the rules. No. Let's re-express the command. The input is \"turn around right twice and run left\". Let's parse \"turn around right\" first.\n\nUsing rule 3: \"around <DIR>\" applies to the verb. So the structure would be <verb> around <DIR>. Like \"jump around right\" is the example. So in this case, if the command is \"turn around right\", then the verb would be \"turn\", but that's not a primitive. But according to the rules, the primitives are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". Hmm. This seems like a problem. Maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps \"turn around right\" is parsed as follows: the verb is \"turn right\", and \"around right\" would be the direction. But that doesn't fit the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the verb here is \"turn\", but since \"turn\" isn't a primitive, maybe we need to think differently. Alternatively, maybe \"turn around right\" is equivalent to \"around right\" applied to a verb \"turn\", but since that's not a primitive, perhaps the user made a mistake. But given that the input is given, perhaps we need to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the command is \"turn around right\", which would be parsed as \"around right\" applied to the verb \"walk\" or something else. But that doesn't make sense. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the command is \"turn around right\", which is a way to say turn 180 degrees, but according to the rules, \"opposite left\" would be two left turns, but \"around\" would be four times. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look again.\n\nThe input is \"turn around right twice and run left\". Let's split into parts:\n\nFirst part: \"turn around right twice\"\n\nSecond part: \"run left\"\n\nAccording to rule 4: \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"turn around right\" is the verb, which is modified by \"twice\". Wait, but \"turn around right\" is the verb? Hmm.\n\nWait, \"around right\" applies to the verb. The main verb here would be \"turn\", and \"around right\" is a modifier. But according to rule 3, \"around right\" would apply to the verb. So \"turn around right\" would expand to four times [turn right + turn]. Wait, but \"turn\" isn't a primitive. Unless \"turn\" here refers to moving direction, but the primitives are \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". So perhaps \"turn around right\" is not a valid command. However, the user provided it, so maybe we need to parse it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the command is \"turn around right twice\", which would be parsed as:\n\n\"around right\" applied to the verb \"turn\", then that sequence repeated twice. But how?\n\nWait, according to rule 3, \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So if the verb is \"turn\", then each repetition would be I_TURN_RIGHT followed by I_TURN. But \"turn\" isn't a primitive. Hmm. Maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the command is a combination of turns and other actions.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended \"turn around right\" to mean turning right four times, which would be like a full circle. But according to the rules, \"jump around right\" would be four times [turn right, jump]. So applying that to \"turn\" would be four times [turn right, turn]. But \"turn\" is not a primitive verb. The primitive verbs are only walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. Therefore, \"turn\" alone is not a primitive, but \"turn left\" and \"turn right\" are. Therefore, \"turn around right\" would not be a valid command unless the verb is one of the primitives.\n\nAh, here's the key. The verb in the \"around <DIR>\" construct must be a primitive verb. Otherwise, it's invalid. But the user input is given, so perhaps the intended parsing is different.\n\nWait, maybe the input is \"turn around right twice\" which is ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps \"turn around right\" is being considered as a single action, but according to the rules, it's about the verb followed by around. So perhaps the actual command is \"turn around right\", but the verb here is \"turn\", which is invalid. Therefore, perhaps there's a misparse, and the correct way is to consider that the user intended \"turn around right\" as \"turn right around\", but I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the command is \"turn left around right twice and run left\", but no, the input is \"turn around right twice and run left\".\n\nWait, perhaps the \"turn\" is a mistake, and the intended command was \"walk around right twice and run left\", but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended \"turn around right\" as \"turn right twice\" (opposite), but according to rule 2, \"opposite <DIR>\" is two turns in DIR then the verb. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the command is \"turn around right\" where \"around\" is treated as a direction, but that's not the case.\n\nThis is a tricky part.

Wait, but the rules don't mention directions unless in the modifiers like \"opposite\", \"around\", etc. Hmm, maybe the structure is that the command can have a verb followed by modifiers that include directions. Let's think again.\n\nWait, the example \"jump around right\" is processed by turning right each time before jumping, so \"around right\" is a modifier on the verb. So \"run right\" might be ambiguous here. But in the given problem, the input is \"run right and run opposite left\". Let's parse according to the given rules.\n\nLet's look at each component:\n\nFirst part: \"run right\" — how does this fit into the rules? The rules don't mention directions unless part of a modifier. So maybe \"run right\" is a mistake, or perhaps \"run\" followed by a direction. But according to the rules, the only direction-related modifiers are in \"opposite <DIR>\", \"around <DIR>\", etc. So maybe \"run right\" is simply \"run\" then \"turn right\"? Wait, but the user input would have to be structured in a way that the verbs and modifiers are clear. Alternatively, perhaps \"run right\" is a primitive verb phrase, but according to rule 1, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left/right. Wait, wait: wait, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"run\" is a primitive verb, but \"run right\" isn't. Wait, rule 1 says \"turn left\" maps to I_TURN_LEFT. So \"run right\" isn't a primitive verb, so maybe the input is ambiguous. Wait, the input is \"run right and run opposite left\". Let's parse this.\n\nWait, perhaps the first part is \"run right\" where \"run\" is the verb and \"right\" is a direction modifier. But according to the given rules, how is that handled? The rules don't mention direction modifiers unless in the \"opposite\", \"around\", etc. So perhaps the \"right\" here is a direction for a turn after the run. But how? Or maybe \"run right\" is equivalent to \"run then turn right\"? But that's not specified in the rules. Hmm, this seems like a problem. Wait, but looking back at the example: the input was \"jump around right\" which was parsed into turning right and jumping four times. So \"around right\" is a modifier. So \"run right\" here doesn't fit any of the rules unless it's a mistake. Wait, perhaps the correct parsing is that \"run\" is the verb and \"right\" is a direction modifier for a turn, but the only modifiers that are recognized are those in the rules. So \"run right\" doesn't have a defined modifier, so maybe the user input is supposed to have the \"run\" followed by a direction as part of a modifier. Alternatively, maybe the \"right\" here is part of a different modifier. Hmm, perhaps the initial command is ambiguous, but according to the problem statement, the agent should process it according to the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run right\" is a misphrasing and should be \"run and turn right\", but that's not given. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, but we have to proceed.\n\nWait, maybe \"run right\" is a turn. But \"run\" is a different verb. No. So perhaps in the input \"run right\", the \"right\" is a direction for a turn, but how? Let's think again.\n\nWait, the rules don't mention direction modifiers for the primitive verbs except in the cases of \"opposite\", \"around\", etc. So unless the \"run right\" is a typo for \"turn right\", but according to the input, it's \"run right\". So perhaps the \"run right\" is a verb plus direction, but not matching any rule, which would mean maybe the agent should ignore the direction? But that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original problem intended that the \"run right\" is a mistake, and the actual input should be parsed as \"run (verb) and then turn right (action)\", but how? Because \"run right\" isn't a primitive. Alternatively, perhaps the \"run right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\" after \"run\", but according to the rules, how would that work? But the rules don't state that a direction after a verb implies a turn. Rule 5 says \"A and B\" is A then B. So perhaps \"run right\" is B, but B must be a command. So this suggests that \"run right\" is a command. But according to the rules, how?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the input \"run right\" isn't a valid command, so the example might have \"run\" and then \"turn right\" via \"run and turn right\". But the problem says to parse according to the given rules. Maybe the correct approach is to assume that \"run right\" is invalid. However, given that the user provided this input, perhaps we need to find another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"run right\" is parsed as the verb \"run\" followed by turning right. But how? The rules don't specify that. Unless the \"right\" here is a modifier that implies turning right, but that's not covered in the rules. Therefore, perhaps the \"run right\" is simply the verb \"run\" followed by a turn right. Wait, but that's an assumption. But given the example: in the example, \"jump around right\" uses the \"around right\" modifier. So perhaps the correct way is to parse \"run right\" as \"run\" plus \"turn right\", but that's not a rule here. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"run right\" is a mistake and the correct input should be \"turn right and run\", but that's not our input. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that the \"run right\" is \"run\" followed by \"turn right\", but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input should be parsed as \"run\" (I_RUN) and \"turn right\" (I_TURN_RIGHT), but how does that fit the input \"run right\"? Hmm. That would be a possible way. So perhaps \"run right\" is parsed as run and then turn right. But according to the rules, there's no rule that says that a direction after a verb implies a turn. Therefore, this is not a valid parsing. But since the user provided this input, maybe we need to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem intended that \"run right\" is a typo for \"turn right\", but that's not stated. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that \"run opposite left\" is parsed, and the first part is \"run right\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input is \"run right\" meaning \"run\" and \"right\" as in a direction, but since there's no rule for direction modifiers on the run verb, maybe the right is ignored. Which can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part of the command is \"run\" and then \"right\" as a separate action. But \"right\" alone isn't a verb, unless \"turn right\" is implied. So \"run\" (I_RUN) and then \"turn right\" (I_TURN_RIGHT). But how does that fit the input? The input is \"run right\", so if \"run\" is a verb and \"right\" is a direction for a turn, then the parsing would be I_RUN I_TURN_RIGHT. But according to the rules, this isn't specified. But given that the example uses \"jump around right\", which is a modifier, maybe the problem expects that \"run right\" is a simple sequence of run and turn right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"run right\" is not a valid command, but the user's input is structured as \"run right and run opposite left\", and we have to parse according to the rules.\n\nLet's move to the second part first: \"run opposite left\".

Rule 1 maps primitive verbs to actions, and directions alone do not automatically translate to turn actions unless specified within modifiers like 'opposite' or 'around'. Therefore, 'run right' may be better interpreted as simply `I_RUN`, ignoring the ambiguous 'right' unless further clarification or defined behavior exists for standalone directions. However, the interpretation of 'run opposite left' as `I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN` is consistent with the rules. The application of 'A and B' as sequential execution is also correct.

The input is \"jump left after jump twice\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the structure. The phrase \"jump left after jump twice\" uses the rule \"A after B\" which means do B then A. So, the main parts here are \"jump left\" as A and \"jump twice\" as B.\n\nStarting with \"jump twice\" (B). According to rule 4, \"twice\" means repeating the verb sequence twice. The verb here is \"jump\", so \"jump twice\" becomes two jumps: I_JUMP I_JUMP.\n\nNext, \"jump left\" (A). The verb is \"jump\" modified by \"left\". But wait, \"left\" here isn't a direction for a turn; it's part of the jump direction. However, looking at the primitive verbs, there's no mention of directional jumps. The primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump left\" might be interpreted as turning left and then jumping. Wait, but the user might mean a jump in the left direction, but according to the given rules, the only actions are the primitives listed. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump left\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, maybe \"jump left\" is a jump followed by turning left? No, that's not right. Wait, rule 2 says \"opposite <DIR>\" becomes two turns in DIR then the verb. But \"left\" here isn't prefixed by \"opposite\". Alternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is intended as turning left first, then jumping. But the problem is that \"jump left\" isn't one of the primitives. So maybe the user made a mistake, but according to the problem statement, I need to parse it according to the rules. Alternatively, maybe \"jump left\" is equivalent to \"turn left then jump\"? But that's not specified. Wait, the example given was \"jump around right\" which expands to four pairs of turn right and jump. So in that case, \"around right\" modifies the jump. So maybe \"left\" here is a direction modifier for the verb. However, the primitive verbs are only the ones listed. Therefore, perhaps the command is invalid, but the problem expects us to process it. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is considered a single action, but according to the rules, the only primitives are the ones listed. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, the user input might have a typo. But assuming that the input is correct, perhaps \"jump left\" should be treated as \"jump\" followed by \"turn left\"? Or maybe \"turn left then jump\"? Or perhaps \"jump\" in the left direction, but since that's not a primitive, maybe the system can't handle that. However, according to the rules, the only actions are the ones listed. Therefore, maybe \"jump left\" is not a valid command. But since the problem gives the input, we have to parse it. Maybe the user intended \"jump\" followed by \"turn left\", but that's not a primitive verb. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is a mistake, and the correct command would be \"turn left then jump\", but the input says \"jump left\". Hmm. Wait, maybe the direction after a verb applies as a turn before the verb. For example, \"jump left\" would be equivalent to \"turn left then jump\". If that's the case, then \"jump left\" would be I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP. But this isn't explicitly stated in the rules. The rules mention \"opposite <DIR>\" and \"around <DIR>\", but other uses of directions. The problem says \"jump left\" is part of the command, but according to the primitive verbs, there's no such action. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that a verb followed by a direction (like left/right) implies turning in that direction before performing the verb. So \"jump left\" would mean turn left then jump. That would make sense. So in this case, \"jump left\" would be I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP. Then, the entire command is \"jump left after jump twice\", which according to rule 6, \"A after B\" becomes B then A. So B is \"jump twice\" (I_JUMP I_JUMP), and A is \"jump left\" (I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP). Therefore, the sequence would be B followed by A: I_JUMP I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP. But wait, the problem states that the output should be the actions separated by spaces. So the final output would be I_JUMP I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP. Let me check again. The input is \"jump left after jump twice\". Rule 6: \"A after B\" = B then A. A is \"jump left\", B is \"jump twice\". \"jump twice\" is \"jump\" repeated twice (rule 4), so I_JUMP I_JUMP. \"jump left\" is interpreted as turn left then jump. So A is I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP. Then combining B then A gives I_JUMP I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP. Additionally, the example for \"jump around right\" gives four pairs of turn right and jump, so the \"around\" rule uses repetition. Therefore, the approach seems correct.

The user input is \"look right after jump around left twice\". Hmm, first, I need to parse each part according to the rules.\n\nStarting with \"jump around left twice\". The \"around left\" part means 4 repetitions of [turn left + jump], right? So each around left would be I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP repeated four times. But then there's \"twice\" attached to that. Wait, \"around left twice\" would mean repeating the entire around left sequence twice. Wait, no. Wait, rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions. Then \"around left\" is 4 times [turn left + jump]. Then \"twice\" would apply to the entire \"jump around left\" part. Wait, the original phrase is \"jump around left twice\". So the \"twice\" applies to the entire \"jump around left\". Wait, but \"jump around left\" itself is a compound verb. Let me parse this.\n\nFirst, \"jump around left\" would be rule 3: around left means 4 times [turn left + jump]. So that sequence would be I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP repeated four times. Then \"twice\" would mean repeating that entire sequence twice. Wait, but rule 4 says \"around <DIR>\" is 4 repetitions. Then \"jump around left\" would be the around action, which is 4 times turn left and jump. Then \"twice\" would mean doing that entire around sequence two times. So \"jump around left twice\" would be the around left sequence (4 times) multiplied by two, making it 8 times? Wait, no. Rule 4 says \"twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So \"jump around left\" is a verb sequence. Wait, \"jump around left\" is a verb (jump) with a modifier (around left). So the \"around left\" applies to the jump. Then \"twice\" would mean to perform that entire around left sequence twice. So each around left is 4 repetitions, so twice would make it 8 repetitions? Or wait, no. Let's clarify. Let's take the example given: \"jump around right\" becomes four turns and jumps. So in this problem, \"jump around left twice\" would be the same as \"jump around left\" done twice. But how is \"jump around left\" structured? It's jump around left, which is 4 repetitions. Then \"twice\" would mean to repeat that entire 4-repetition sequence twice. So the total would be two times the four steps. So each time, you do the four [turn left + jump], then again four times. Wait, no. No, if \"jump around left\" is the action, then \"jump around left twice\" would be doing that action twice. But the \"jump around left\" action itself is four repetitions. So doing it twice would be 4 * 2 = 8 repetitions. Hmm, but according to rule 4, \"around <DIR>\" is 4 reps. So \"jump around left\" is equivalent to [turn left jump] *4. Then \"twice\" would make that entire sequence twice, so [turn left jump] *4 *2? Wait, no. Wait, the \"twice\" applies to the entire verb phrase. So \"jump around left twice\" would be (jump around left) *2. Which would be each around left is 4 times, so two times that would be 8 times. But maybe not. Let me check the example given in the problem. The example input was \"jump around right\", output was four turns and jumps. So in that case, \"jump around right\" is four times. So if there was a \"jump around right twice\", according to rule 4, \"verb twice\" repeats the verb sequence. So \"jump around right\" is a verb sequence. So doing it twice would be doing the four repetitions twice. So total of 8 actions (each around is 4 actions, times two). But wait, each around is 4 repetitions of [turn + jump], so each repetition adds two actions. So \"jump around left\" would be 4 * 2 = 8 actions. Then \"twice\" would make that again twice as much, so 16 actions. But the example output for \"jump around right\" is 8 actions (four turns and jumps). So \"jump around right twice\" would be 16 actions.\n\nWait, in the example:\n\nIN: jump around right\n\nOUT: I_TURN_RIGHT I_JUMP repeated four times, which is 4 * 2 = 8 actions.\n\nSo \"jump around right\" is equivalent to four times [turn right, jump]. Then \"twice\" would apply to that entire sequence, so the entire 8-action sequence is repeated twice, making 16.\n\nSo back to the current problem: \"jump around left twice\". That would be the same as [turn left jump] four times, then repeated twice. So total of 8 * 2 = 16.\n\nWait, but the original problem's input is \"look right after jump around left twice\".\n\nWait, the entire command is \"look right after jump around left twice\". According to rule 6, \"A after B\" means do B then A. So the structure is:\n\n\"A after B\" = B then A.\n\nIn this case, A is \"look right\", B is \"jump around left twice\". So first do B, then do A.\n\nBut first, parse each part. So first, process B: jump around left twice. Then process A: look right.\n\nWait, \"look right\" is not a primitive verb listed. The primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left/right. Wait, \"look right\" is a verb here. But according to the rules, the primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. So the problem is, is \"look right\" a primitive verb? Because according to the rules, the primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" is not in the list. Wait, this might be a trick part. Wait, the input is \"look right after jump around left twice\". But according to the rules, the primitives are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look right\" would be a verb not in the list. Hmm, but the user might have made a mistake, or perhaps we have to interpret look right as a turn right? Or maybe \"look right\" is not a valid primitive, but in the problem statement, the example input uses \"jump around left twice\", which is okay. So in the current input, \"look right\" is a problem. Because according to the rules, only the primitive verbs (including turn left, turn right) are allowed. So \"look right\" would be equivalent to turn right? Or is \"look\" a typo? Or perhaps the problem expects that \"look right\" is a different action, but according to the rules, we have to map primitive verbs to their uppercase counterparts. If \"look right\" is not a primitive verb, then how to handle this?\n\nWait, the user provided the input. Let me check the problem again. The problem says \"look right after jump around left twice\". The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"look\" is not a primitive verb. But according to the rules, the agent must parse the input into the uppercase actions. So how to handle \"look right\"? Maybe it's a typo and should be \"turn right\", but perhaps we need to consider that \"look right\" is equivalent to \"turn right\". But the rules don't state that. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, but according to the given problem, we need to process the input. Wait, the problem example uses \"jump around right\" which is valid. Now the current input has \"look right\", which is not a primitive. Unless \"look right\" is supposed to be a primitive verb here. But according to the rules, only the ones listed are allowed. So maybe the correct approach is to ignore \"look right\", but that can't be. Wait, perhaps \"look right\" should be treated as \"turn right\", but that's an assumption. Alternatively, maybe \"look right\" is a new primitive verb. But according to the rules, the mapping is only for the verbs listed. So the problem may have a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is a typo, and the intended command was \"turn right\". But assuming that the input is correct, how to proceed?\n\nWait, perhaps \"look right\" is equivalent to turning right. Because looking in a direction might involve turning. But according to the rules, only the primitive verbs listed should be used. Since \"look\" is not listed, perhaps the correct action is to output \"I_TURN_RIGHT\" for \"look right\"? But the user might expect that. However, the rules don't mention this, but the problem expects us to process the input as per the rules. So perhaps we have to treat \"look right\" as \"turn right\". Alternatively, maybe \"look right\" is a different action, but the problem hasn't specified it. Hmm. But the problem must have a solution. Let's proceed under the assumption that \"look right\" is a typo and should be \"turn right\". Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that \"look right\" is equivalent to a single action, which would be \"I_LOOK_RIGHT\" or something. But according to the rules, the only mappings are the ones given. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, but we need to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps \"look right\" is a primitive verb that maps to I_TURN_RIGHT. Because \"look\" direction would equate to turning in that direction.

The \"twice\" applies to that. So first parse \"jump left\". According to rule 1, jump is I_JUMP, left is I_TURN_LEFT. But wait, \"jump left\" isn't a primitive verb. Wait, no. Wait, \"jump left\" could be ambiguous. Wait, the primitive verbs are the ones listed. The original rules say that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions. The primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"jump left\" would be a compound command. Wait, but according to rule 1, \"turn left\" maps to I_TURN_LEFT. So \"jump left\" would actually be \"jump then turn left\"? Or is \"jump left\" a single verb? Hmm, the initial rules say \"primitive verbs\", so \"jump\" is a primitive verb, and \"turn left\" is a primitive verb. So \"jump left\" isn't a primitive verb. Therefore, the command is \"jump left\", which would be parsed as \"jump\" followed by \"turn left\"? Or is \"left\" here part of the verb? Wait, the problem statement might be ambiguous here. But according to the rules, the primitive verbs are only those listed. So \"jump\" is a primitive verb. \"turn left\" is a primitive verb. So if the command is \"jump left\", then perhaps it's \"jump\" followed by \"turn left\". But wait, the original example: in the example input \"jump around right\", the output is a sequence of turns and jumps, which uses the rule 3. So in that case, \"jump\" is the verb, and \"around right\" is a modifier. So in this problem, the structure is that the verb is a primitive verb, and then there's a direction or modifiers. So \"jump left\" would be \"jump\" as the verb and \"left\" as the direction. Wait, but according to the rules, \"turn left\" is a primitive verb. But if the command is \"jump left\", then \"left\" isn't a verb. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake. Wait, but the problem says \"semantic parsing agent for navigation commands\", so perhaps \"jump left\" isn't a valid command. Unless the \"left\" here is a direction, but the primitive verbs are only those listed. Wait, the input here is \"jump left twice\". So the original command is \"jump left\", and \"twice\". But according to the rules, \"jump\" is a primitive verb. So perhaps \"jump left\" is not a valid command. Wait, but the example in the problem uses \"jump around right\", which uses the 'around right' after the verb. So perhaps the structure is that the verb is a primitive verb (like jump, run, etc.), and then there's a direction modifier (like around, opposite, left, right) that modifies the verb. Wait, but how does that work? Let's re-examine the rules.\n\nRule 2: \"opposite <DIR>\" = two turns in DIR then the verb. So, for example, \"opposite left\" would mean two turns left, then the verb. Wait, but how is that applied? Like, if the command is \"walk opposite left\", then you do two turns left, then walk. So the \"opposite\" modifier affects the direction by turning twice.\n\nRule 3: \"around <DIR>\" = 4 repetitions of [turn DIR + verb]. So \"jump around right\" would be turn right, jump; repeat four times. Which gives the example output.\n\nRule 5: \"A and B\" = A then B.\n\nRule 6: \"A after B\" = B then A.\n\nSo in the current input: \"run thrice and jump left twice\". Let's parse each part.\n\nFirst part: \"run thrice\" → run three times. So I_RUN repeated thrice.\n\nSecond part: \"jump left twice\". Hmm. The \"jump left\" part. Is \"left\" a direction modifier here? If \"jump\" is the verb, then \"left\" could be a direction modifier. But according to the rules, modifiers like \"around\", \"opposite\", etc. are covered. However, the original rules don't mention simple direction modifiers like \"jump left\". Wait, but the primitive verbs include \"turn left\" and \"turn right\". So \"jump left\" may not be a valid command. Wait, but perhaps \"jump left\" is a combination of \"jump\" and then \"turn left\"? Or maybe \"jump left\" is equivalent to \"jump then turn left\"? But that's not specified in the rules. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and intended \"turn left\" instead of \"jump left\", but the input is as given.\n\nWait, the user input is \"run thrice and jump left twice\". Let's check. The \"jump left\" here might be a mistake. But according to the problem's rules, how should we parse it?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is a misstatement, and the intended meaning is \"jump then turn left\", but according to the rules, unless there's a rule that allows combining verbs, we need to parse \"jump\" and \"left\" as separate verbs. Wait, but \"jump\" is a verb and \"left\" is a direction. But how does that fit into the rules?\n\nWait, perhaps \"jump left\" is a command that isn't using the primitive verbs. But according to the problem's rules, primitive verbs are walk, run, jump, turn left, turn right. So \"turn left\" is a primitive verb. So \"jump left\" is not a primitive verb. Therefore, maybe the input has a typo. But given that the input is as stated, how to parse it?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump left\" is a compound command. For example, \"jump\" followed by \"turn left\". But how? The user input would have to be written as \"jump and turn left\" to be parsed as such. Alternatively, if \"jump left\" is considered a single verb, but according to the rules, it's not listed, so it's invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the user's input. For example, \"jump left\" should be \"turn left jump\", but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" is a mistake, and the intended command is \"jump then turn left\", but the user wrote \"jump left\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump left\" is a way to say \"jump while turning left\", but according to the given rules, how to parse it?\n\nThis is a problem because the input seems to have a command that's not covered by the rules. But the user has given this command, so perhaps we need to find a way to parse it.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem's rules, the first rule says that primitive verbs map to uppercase actions, so each verb must be one of the listed. Therefore, \"jump left\" is not a primitive verb. So perhaps the correct parsing is \"jump\" followed by \"left\". But \"left\" is a direction. Wait, \"turn left\" is a verb. So \"left\" alone is not a verb. Therefore, perhaps the input \"jump left\" is invalid. But since the user provided this input, maybe we need to assume that \"jump left\" is equivalent to \"jump then turn left\". Or perhaps \"left\" is a direction modifier for the verb, but there's no rule given for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"jump left twice\" part is parsed as \"jump (left twice)\"? But how?\n\nWait, considering that the user wrote \"jump left twice\", the \"twice\" applies to the \"jump left\" sequence. So \"jump left\" would be a sequence of actions that is then repeated twice. So if \"jump left\" is considered a verb followed by a direction, which actions would they be?\n\nIf \"jump\" is the verb, then \"jump left\" would be ambiguous. But according to the rules, there's no way to handle a direction after a verb unless it's in a modifier like \"around\", \"opposite\", etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump left\" is a misstatement, and the intended meaning is \"turn left and jump\", but that's speculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"jump left\" should be parsed as \"jump\" followed by \"turn left\", so the sequence I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT, and then \"twice\" would mean doing that twice. But according to rule 4, \"twice\" applies to the verb sequence. Wait, rule 4 says \"<verb> twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. So if the command is \"jump left twice\", perhaps \"jump left\" is considered a verb sequence with modifiers. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"jump left\" is a command that uses a direction modifier, but since the rules don't specify handling of directions, except in the cases of \"opposite\", \"around\", etc., maybe \"jump left\" would be parsed as \"jump then turn left\", and then \"twice\" would mean doing that twice. So the entire \"jump left\" part would be I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT, then twice would make that sequence repeat twice.\n\nBut according to the rules, how do we parse \"jump left twice\"?\n\nRule 4 says \"verb twice\" = repeat the verb sequence twice. But \"jump left\" isn't a verb, it's two verbs? Or maybe \"jump\"", "rationality_label": "No Razonable", "rationality_judgement": "Reasonable", "confidence_score": 85, "model_reflection": "The initial interpretation of 'jump left' as 'I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT' follows the rule that directional verbs like 'left' map to actions such as I_TURN_LEFT. Since there is no explicit definition for compound actions like 'jump left', interpreting it as a sequence of the verb followed by the directional turn is consistent with the pattern used in similar cases (e.g., 'turn left' → I_TURN_LEFT). Furthermore, 'run thrice' correctly applies Rule 4, and 'A and B' correctly applies Rule 5. The breakdown and sequencing align with the provided rules and example.", "new_response": "None"}
