The phrase 'jump right' does not imply turning right and then jumping; rather, it implies jumping in the 'right' direction. However, according to the given rules, there is no direct mapping for directional jumps (e.g., jump right) unless specified via primitive verbs. The correct approach would be to interpret 'jump right' as invalid unless further clarification exists, or to treat 'jump' as a primitive verb and 'right' separately, possibly as a direction modifier. Additionally, 'jump opposite right thrice' should be interpreted as two turns right followed by a jump, repeated three times.
