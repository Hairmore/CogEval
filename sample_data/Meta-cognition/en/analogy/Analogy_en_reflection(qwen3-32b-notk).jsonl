It is not a direct source-to-product like paddy to rice.\n\n- **B: cotton:cotton seed** – Cotton comes from the cotton plant, and cotton seeds are found inside the cotton boll. However, this is more of a **part-whole** relationship rather than a source-to-processed product. Cotton fiber is obtained from the boll, not from the seed.\n\n- **C: watermelon:melon seeds** – Again, this is a part-whole relationship. Melon seeds are parts of the watermelon, not a processed version of it.\n\n- **D: peanut:peanut butter** – This is closer to the paddy:rice relationship. Peanut butter is made from ground peanuts (often with added oil and salt), so it represents a **raw material to processed product** relationship, similar to how rice is derived from paddy.\n\nHowever, in the case of **paddy:rice**, the transformation involves removing the husk, which makes rice the edible grain within the paddy. In contrast, **peanut butter** is made by grinding the entire peanut into a paste, not extracting a core component. \n\nThe closest analogy remains **B: cotton:cotton seed**, if we interpret the question as referring to the **plant-to-edible/usable component** relationship, where the usable part (rice grain or cotton fiber) is embedded within the original structure.

Copperplate is a particular type or sub-style of calligraphy, characterized by its fluid, curvilinear strokes.\n\nNow let's examine the options:\n\n**A: greek mythology : chinese mythology**  \nThis is a parallel comparison between two distinct cultural mythological systems.

However, if we interpret this as a garden named for peaches, then it becomes a location defined by the presence of a specific plant. This is not a clear case of a broader category and a specific style.

The analogy is not precise.\n\n- **B: library:reading room:literature retrieval**  \n  - A library is the system, a reading room is a component within the library, and literature retrieval is the function conducted in the reading room.
